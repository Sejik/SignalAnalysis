This folder includes all models and precomputed tables used by the eConnectome software.

The standard 10-5 system and electrode locations in spherical head model 
developed by R. Oostenveld and P. Praamstra are used in the software. Please see 
'R. Oostenveld and P. Praamstra. The five percent electrode system for
high-resolution EEG and ERP measurements. Clin Neurophysiol, 112:713-719, 2001'
and 'http://robertoostenveld.ruhosting.nl/index.php/electrode/' for details 
about the 10-5 system and electrode locations in spherical head model.

The cortex model and BEM models used in the software are constructed based on the 
standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain. Please see
