function varargout = pop_main_about(varargin)
% pop_main_about - display statement about the eConnectome software.
%
% Usage: 
%            1. type 
%               >> pop_main_about
%               or call pop_main_about to start the popup GUI. 
%           
%            2. call pop_main_about from the main econnectome GUI ('Menu bar -> About').
