%In BBCI_APPLY there are two central structures. 
%
%- The 'bbci' structure specifies WHAT should be done and HOW:
%data acquisition, processing, feature extraction, classification,
%determining the control signal, and calling the application.
%It is the input to bbci_apply.
%
%- The 'data' structure is used to store the acquired signals, and various
%steps of processed data, as well as some state information.
%It is the working variable of bbci_apply.
%
%
%* Structure BBCI (defaults are set in bbci_apply_setDefaults):
%
%bbci.source - Defines the sources for acquiring signals
%  * struct array with fields:
%  .acquire_fcn   [FUNC, default '@bbci_acquire_bv']
%  .acquire_param [CELL ARRAY, default {}]: parameters to acquire_fcn
%  .min_blocklength [DOUBLE, default 40] minimum blocklength [msec] that should
%                 be acquired before dat is passed to further processing
%                 (in bbci_apply_setDefaults a variant .min_blocklength_sa
%                 is added for convenience.)
%  .clab          [CELL ARRAY of CHAR, default {'*'}]
%  .record_signals  [BOOL, default 0] specifies whether bbci_apply should
%                 record the signals to file.
%  .record_basename  [CHAR, default ''] filename for recording the signals.

%  .record_param  [CELL, default {}] Cell array of parameters that are
%                 passed to the recording function, see bbci_apply_recordSignals.
%  .marker_mapping_fcn  [FUNC, default []] handle of a function that is used
%                 to map markers from CHAR to DOUBLE.
%                 Typically not required
%  .log           [STRUCT] This field specifies, whether source-specific
%                 information should be logged:

%                    'data_packets': write a log message, if the length of an
%                        acquired block is larger than .min_blocklength,
