# Requirements

The toolbox runs with Matlab Version 2007 or later. It works in general with
Linux, Mac OS and Windows. Some functions or functionality are not available in
all OS. Savnig figures as PDF works only in Linux, and sending triggers via the
parallel port and the most signal acquisition functions (for online use) are
only available for Windows.

Functions for data acquisition are implemented so far for the following
hardware:

* Brain Products: Brain amps
* g.tec: g.USBamp
* TMSi: Porti and Mobita
* Enobio
* Emotiv
* NIRx NIRS system
