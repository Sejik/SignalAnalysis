<h3>Compilation fails while building moc_briconwidget.cxx</h3>

<p>This is probably due to a badly installed Qwt plugin. The instructions on how to install the plugin can be found in the supplementary document: <a href="prereqs.html">Preparing a build environment</a>.</p>

<p>Following my instructions, the plugin should've installed into the plugins/designer directory in your Qt installation directory. If you choose to install it elsewhere then Qt tools: <em>designer</em>; <em>moc</em>; <em>uic</em>, etc., won't be able to find it. To tell Qt tools where to find the plugin use the <em>designer</em> tool's preferences has a place where you can add custom directories to the "Plugin Paths."</p>

<p>A quick test of the plugin is to run Qt's <em>designer</em> application. If the plugin is okay you'll see a Qwt pane in the tools on the left-hand side which will be filled with the Qwt widgets.</p>

<h3>Run-time problems on CentOS</h3>

<p>The current redhat binaries can be used on CentOS-4 platforms as long as you have the correct compatability libraries installed. If, at run-time, you get an error message: <kbd>.../usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.4' not found (required by...</kbd>, then try <kbd>yum install compat-libstdc++-33</kbd>.</p>
