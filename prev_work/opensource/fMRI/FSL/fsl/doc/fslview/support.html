<h3>Compilation problems</h3>

<h4><a name="1" id="1">Error while building moc_briconwidget.cxx</a></h4>

<p>This is probably due to a badly installed Qwt plugin. The
instructions on how to install the plugin can be found in the
supplementary
document: <a href="../fslviewbuild/prereqs.html">Preparing a build
environment</a>.</p>

<p>Following my instructions, the plugin should've installed into the
plugins/designer directory in your Qt installation directory. If you
choose to install it elsewhere then Qt
tools: <em>designer</em>; <em>moc</em>; <em>uic</em>, etc., won't be
able to find it. To tell Qt tools where to find the plugin use
the <em>designer</em> tool's preferences which has a place where you
can add custom directories to the "Plugin Paths."</p>

<p>A quick test of the plugin is to run Qt's <em>designer</em>
application. If the plugin is okay you'll see a Qwt pane in the tools
on the left-hand side which will be filled with the Qwt widgets.</p>

<h3>Run-time issues</h3>

<h4><a name="2" id="2">GLIBCXX_3.4.4 problems on, e.g., CentOS</a></h4>

<p>
So far I've only had reports of this issue for CentOS users trying to
use our RedHat build. It is entirely conceivable that the problem may
occur for other build and run-time mixtures.
</p>

<p>The current RedHat binaries can be used on the CentOS-4 platform as
long as you have the correct compatability libraries installed. If, at
run-time, you get an error message: </p>

<p>
<kbd>
.../usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.4' not found (required by...
</kbd>
</p>

<p>
then try installing the compat libstdc++: <kbd>yum install
compat-libstdc++-33</kbd>.
</p>

</p>

<h4><a name="3" id="3">Missing libGL version info</a></h4>

<p>The warning looks like:</p>

<p>
<kbd>.../fslview: /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.1: no version information
available (required by .../libvtkRendering.so.5.0)</kbd>
</p>

<p>I've seen this kind of error on a couple of platforms but so far
haven't correlated it to any actual problem running fslview. Please
ignore it for now.</p>
