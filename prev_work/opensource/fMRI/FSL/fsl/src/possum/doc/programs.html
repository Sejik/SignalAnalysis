<UL>

<LI><b>Possum</b> - the POSSUM GUI.

<br><br><LI><b>pulse</b> -  the POSSUM command-line program which the GUI calls when the
setup has been completed and <b>GO</b> is pressed. It generates the pulse 
sequence.

<br><br><LI><b>possumX</b> - the POSSUM script which the GUI calls when the
setup has been completed and <b>GO</b> is pressed. It generates the image after the pulse sequence is generated.


<br><br><LI><b>generate_brain</b> - the POSSUM script which can be used to generate the input object.


<br><br><LI><b>generate_b0</b> - the POSSUM script which can be used to generate the b0 inhomogeneity volume.


<br><br><LI><b>possum</b>  - the POSSUM command-line program which possumX calls to generate the signal (k-space data, see <a href="output.html">Possum Output</a>).

<br><br><LI><b>systemnoise</b>  - the POSSUM command-line program which possumX calls to add the noise to the signal (see <a href="noise.html">Adding noise</a>).

<br><br><LI><b>signal2image</b>  - the POSSUM command-line program which possumX calls to convert the signal to the image (i.e. re-orders the signal into the k-space and then does the reconstruction). It can also just convert the signal into the k-space (i.e. just does the reordering without the reconstruction). See <a href="output.html">Possum Output</a>.

<br><br><LI><b>b0calc</b>  - the POSSUM command-line program which you can use to generate the B0 inhomogeneity basis set. See  <a href="input.html">Input files</a>.

<br><br><LI><b>read_pulse.m</b>  - the POSSUM MATLAB program which you can use to view binary files in MATLAB.

<br><br><LI><b>write_pulse.m</b>  - the POSSUM  MATLAB program which you can use to save files you made in MATLAB into the binary form needed sometimes for POSSUM.
