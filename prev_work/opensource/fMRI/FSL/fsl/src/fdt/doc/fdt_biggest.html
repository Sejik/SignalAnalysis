<h3>find_the_biggest</h3>
<b>find_the_biggest</b> is a command line utility that performs hard
segmentation of a seed region on the basis of outputs of <a
href="fdt_probtrackx.html"><b>probtrackx</b></a> when <b>classification targets</b> are being used.

<p>The output of <b>Connectivity-based seed classification</b> is a single volume for
each target mask, named <b>seeds_to_{target}</b> where {target} is replaced
by the file name of the relevant target mask. In these output images, the
value of each voxel within the seed mask is the number of samples seeded
from that voxel reaching the target mask. <b>find_the_biggest</b> classifies
seed voxels according to the target mask with which they show the highest
probability of connection. It is run as follows:
<p><b>find_the_biggest list_of_volumes outputname</b>
Where the list of volumes is the outputs of <b>Connectivity-based seed
classification</b> (i.e., files named seeds_to_target1 etc etc).

<p>The example on the right uses <a href="fdt_probtrackx.html"><b>probtrackx</b></a> and find_the_biggest to perform hard segmentation
of the thalamus on the basis of its connections to cortex.
