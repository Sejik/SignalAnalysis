<p><i><b>New version:</b> FSL-VBM v1.1 has switched the nonlinear
  registration to using <a href=../fnirt/index.html>FNIRT</a> (FMRIB's
  Nonlinear Registration Tool). FNIRT is about 10-15 times faster than
  IRTK on structural data and possibly a little more 'accurate'. An
  FSL-VBM v1.1 analysis is <b>not</b> compatible with an older
  analysis. To see the full list of changes from the previous version
  see <a href="#new">what's new</a></i>.

<a name="intro"></a><p><hr><H2>Introduction: Why FSL-VBM?</H2>

You might want to investigate voxel-wise changes in the grey matter
volume/topography in one population related to (e.g.) one clinical
score, or between several populations.  Or you might be carrying out a
functional study (fMRI, PET) and want to test whether the effect seen
in this study is possibly caused by structural GM differences.

<p>This approach is unbiased, in that it requires no a priori
  information about the location of these possible differences in the
  grey matter, and is not operator-dependant. It follows the optimised
  VBM protocol developed by Good et al., 2001.

<p>To be able to compare all the GM images on a voxelwise basis, they
need to be transformed into a standard space, which involves the use
of non-linear registration.  This approach is somewhat of a trade-off:
in order to be able to compare voxel-by-voxel the GM volume in your
images, you want all the structures across your subjects to match
(that's why you use a non-linear registration), but not "too much" or
you would not be able to see any difference, if all these structures
were perfectly aligned across the subjects (that's why you use limited
degrees-of-freedom for the non-linear registration).

<p>Please bear in mind that the interpretation of the results you may
obtain with such voxel-wise analysis has inherent limitations,
however. It is sometimes not possible to determine if the results you
may find are the consequence of an effective reduced thickness or
atrophy in the grey matter, or rather an indirect reflection of a
different gyrification pattern. Indeed, it might be possible that a
misalignment of the gyri/sulci or even different folding patterns may
lead to the difference of grey matter distribution that you have
found.  Moreover, there is theoretically a continuum of results
dependent on the degrees of freedom of the non-rigid registration used
(here free-form deformation with 20 mm initial control point spacing)
and the amount of smoothing.

If you use this tool in your research, you may want to incude the
  following methods description, and please reference the papers
  listed below:

<p>Structural data was analysed with FSL-VBM, a voxel-based
morphometry style analysis [Ashburner 2000, Good 2001] carried out
with FSL tools [Smith 2004]. First, structural images were
brain-extracted using BET [Smith 2002]. Next, tissue-type segmentation
was carried out using FAST4 [Zhang 2001]. The resulting grey-matter
partial volume images were then aligned to MNI152 standard space using
the affine registration tool FLIRT [Jenkinson 2001, 2002], followed
optionally by nonlinear registration using FNIRT [Andersson 2007a,
2007b], which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp
field [Rueckert 1999]. The resulting images were averaged to create a
study-specific template, to which the native grey matter images were
then non-linearly re-registered. The registered partial volume images
were then modulated (to correct for local expansion or contraction) by
dividing by the Jacobian of the warp field. The modulated segmentated
images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a
sigma of ?? mm. Finally, voxelwise GLM was applied using
permutation-based non-parametric testing, correcting for multiple
comparisons across space.

<a name="overview"></a><p><hr><H2>Running FSL-VBM - Overview</H2>

Running FSL-VBM involves a few simple steps:

<UL>
<LI>prepare your T1-weighted images in the right format
<LI><b>fslvbm_1_bet</b> - carry out brain extraction on all T1 images 
<LI><b>fslvbm_2_template</b> - create the study-specific symmetric GM template 
<LI><b>fslvbm_3_proc</b> - register all the GM inages to the template, modulate and smooth them with different kernel sizes and finally runs an initial GLM analysis for qualitative evaluation
<LI><b>randomise</b> - carry out voxelwise GLM analysis using permutation testing
</UL>



<a name="detail"></a><p><hr><H2>Running FSL-VBM - In detail</H2>



<a name="prepare"></a><p><H3>A - Prepare your data for the FSL-VBM study</H3>

a) Place all your T1-weighted data in your FSL-VBM directory.

<p>For instance:

<p><code>mkdir my_fsl_vbm</code>

<p>Then copy into your FSL-VBM directory all of your subjects' T1 images, giving each subject's T1 image a different name, preferably with each prefix corresponding to each of your group, for example:

<p><pre>
CON_2304.nii.gz
CON_2878.nii.gz
CON_3456.nii.gz
CON_4133.nii.gz
CON_4690.nii.gz
PAT_2042.nii.gz
PAT_2280.nii.gz
PAT_2632.nii.gz
PAT_3193.nii.gz
PAT_4134.nii.gz
PAT_5357.nii.gz
PAT_6659.nii.gz</pre>


<p>b) If you have more than one group and the number of subjects in
  each is not the same, choose (at random) among the biggest group(s)
  the images that you will use to create the study-specific template,
  with the same number as of the smallest group (in order to create an
  unbiased template - see below for further explanation). Once you've
  chosen which T1 images to keep to build the template, put all the
  selected names of exams in a file called <code>template_list</code>
  in your FSL-VBM directory.

<p>All your different populations included in this study MUST be represented in the template construction.
<p>For instance, as we have only 5 controls for 7 patients, we have to select 5 patients out of the 7:

<p><pre>for g in CON_2304.nii.gz CON_2878.nii.gz CON_3456.nii.gz CON_4133.nii.gz CON_4690.nii.gz \
  PAT_2042.nii.gz PAT_2632.nii.gz PAT_3193.nii.gz PAT_4134.nii.gz PAT_6659.nii.gz; do
echo $g >> template_list
done</pre>

<p>c) At this point you should have a quick look at all your data to
  check that all subjects' structural images are what you expected:

<p><pre>slicesdir `imglob *`</pre>

<p>The <code>imglob</code> command lists all of your input images. 
  The <code>slicesdir</code> command takes the
  list of images and creates a simple web-page containing snapshots
  for each of the images. Once it has finished running it tells you
  the name of the web page to open in your web browser, to view the
  snapshots. Have a careful look.
  
<p>d) It's a good idea to consider your cross-subject statistical
  model <b>before</b> you run the FSL-VBM analysis. So you should at
  this point create your <code>design.mat</code> and <code>design.con</code> in your FSL-VBM
  directory; see the <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise
  manual</a>.

<p><b>WARNING!!!</b> The order of the rows in your design.mat model
MUST match the order of your images when doing an 'ls' command in your
FSL-VBM directory.

<a name="step1"></a><br><br><br><p><H3>B - Extracting brain information: fslvbm_1_bet</H3>

<p>The first FSL-VBM script moves all your input images into a
  new <code>struc</code> subdirectory (and adding "_struc" to the end
  of each filename). It then runs brain extraction on the images. You
  can either use the <code>-b</code> option to get default BET
  behaviour, or use the <code>-N</code> option if your images include
  a lot of neck (which most of the time confounds the BET
  preprocessing).

<p>To run this first script, just type:

<p><pre>fslvbm_1_bet -b</pre>

<p>or <pre>fslvbm_1_bet -N</pre>

<p>in your FSL-VBM directory.

<p>At the end of this step, it is once again worth <b>CHECKING</b> the
brain images (*_brain.*) in your <code>struc</code> directory by
loading the new slicesdir output into a web browser. Brain extraction
is the step which is the most likely to need tweaking in the FSL-VBM
protocol. If you do not get good results with either option, you can
try adding other <a href="../bet2/index.html">bet</a> options after
the <code>-b</code> or <code>-N</code> option.

<p>If you later want to add more subjects to your analysis then just
  put the new subjects' images inside the toplevel directory
  (e.g. <code>my_fsl_vbm</code>) and
  re-run <code>fslvbm_1_bet</code>. Don't forget to
  update <code>template_list</code> if necessary.

<a name="step2"></a><br><br><br><p><H3>C - Creating the template: fslvbm_2_template</H3>

<p><img src="template.jpg" align="right">The second step of the
FSL-VBM protocol creates the study-specific GM template.<br>  All
brain-extracted images are segmented into GM, WM and CSF. GM images
(*_struc_GM) and their respective mirror images (*_struc_GM_xflipped)
are then registered to the GM ICBM-152 template. The registered GM
images and their mirror images are concatenated into a 4D image called
"template_GM_4D" and averaged to create the study-specific GM template
at 2x2x2mm<sup>3</sup> resolution in standard space.

<p>If you have different populations, they should all be represented
in your template. You should use the same number of subjects from each
in the construction of the study-specific template. This is to avoid
any bias during the registration step that would have consisted in
favouring one of the groups. For example, if you have only controls in
your template, or more controls than patients, it is likely that the
non-linear registration would be more accurate for your control
subjects than for your patients. Then you cannot distinguish, in your
results showing differences in the GM volume distribution between the
two groups, what is actually disease-related from what is
registration-related!

<p> For this step, you have two options: either you want to create a
template based on an affine registration (<code>-a</code> option) of GM images to the GM
ICBM-152 template, or on a non-linear registration (<code>-n</code> option).

<p>So to run this second step script, just type:

<p><pre>fslvbm_2_template -a</pre>

<p>or

<p><pre>fslvbm_2_template -n</pre>

<p>in your FSL-VBM directory.

<p>Once this is completed, <b>CHECK</b> the "template_GM_4D" image in
<code>struc</code> with the movie loop in fslview.

<a name="step3"></a><br><br><br><p><H3>D - Processing the native GM images: fslvbm_3_proc</H3>

<p>The final script will non-linearly register all your GM images to
the study-specific template and concatenate them into a 4D image
("GM_merg") in the <code>stats</code> directory in your working
FSL-VBM directory. The FSL-VBM protocol also introduces a compensation
(or "modulation") for the contraction/enlargement due to the
non-linear component of the transformation: each voxel of each
registered grey matter image is divided by the Jacobian of the warp
field (see Good et al., 2001). All the modulated registered GM images
are concatenated into a 4D image in the stats directory
("GM_mod_merg") and then smoothed ("GM_mod_merg_s3" for instance) by a
range of Gaussian kernels; sigma = 2, 3, 4mm, i.e., approximately from
FWHM = 2x2.3 = 4.6mm to FWHM = 9mm.

<p>Finally, this last step gets everything ready for you to run
permutation-based non-parametric inference using the design.mat and
design.con which you supplied, a mask of the GM ("GM_mask") and the 4D
multi-subject concatenated processed data (e.g. "GM_mod_merg_s3"). The
script runs randomise with inference (generation of p-value maps)
turned off, so that it very quickly creates just the raw tstat
maps. These tstats maps should help you decide which smoothing is the
most relevant to feed into a full run of randomise, and which
threshold to use for the cluster-based thresholding
(option <code>-c</code> in
the <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise command</a>); however,
in general we would recommend using the TFCE option (-T) instead of
the cluster-based thresholding.

<p><b>WARNING!!!</b> By default fslvbm_3_proc concatenates the images
in alphabetical order (following the names that they started with);
make sure this matches the subject ordering assumed in your design.mat
model.


<p>All of the above is done simply by running the script:

<p><pre>fslvbm_3_proc</pre>

<p>in your FSL-VBM directory.

<p>Please do not forget the final <b>CHECK</b> of the 4D image of modulated registered GM images "GM_mod_merg" using the movie loop in fslview.

<a name="results"></a><br><br><br><p><H3>E - Displaying your FSL-VBM results</H3>


<p><img src="results.jpg" align="right">We strongly recommend using randomise (permutation
  testing) for inference in VBM-style analysis and not Gaussian random
  field theory (GRF), as the approximations underlying the latter are
  not generally appropriate in such analyses.

<p><b>E1 - Displaying TFCE-based thresholding results</b>
  
<p>Once you have chosen the most appropriate smoothing (e.g. sigma =
3mm) for the TFCE-based analysis, run randomise
(see <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise usage</a>), for
instance:

<pre>randomise -i GM_mod_merg_s3 -m GM_mask -o fslvbm -d design.mat -t design.con -T -n 5000 -V</pre>

<p>You can then view the (1-p) corrected p-value images in FSLView:

<pre>fslview $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm fslvbm_tfce_corrp_tstat1 -l Red-Yellow -b 0.949,1</pre>

<p><b>E2 - Displaying cluster-based thresholding results</b>
  
<p>Once you have chosen the most appropriate smoothing (e.g. sigma = 3mm) and threshold (e.g. t &gt; 2.3) for the cluster-based correction, then feed them into a full run of
randomise (see <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise usage</a>), for instance:

<pre>randomise -i GM_mod_merg_s3 -m GM_mask -o fslvbm -d design.mat -t design.con -c 2.3 -n 5000 -V</pre>

<p>Then you can threshold your "_clustere_corrp_" images (corrected p-values maps) at 0.95 to keep only the significant
clusters and use it to mask the <b>corresponding</b> tstats map:

<pre>fslmaths fslvbm_clustere_corrp_tstat1 -thr 0.95 -bin mask_pcorrected
fslmaths fslvbm_tstat1 -mas mask_pcorrected fslvbm_tstat1_corrected
</pre>

before displaying it with fslview overlaid on the template_GM or the MNI152 template for example:

<pre>fslview $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm fslvbm_tstat1_corrected -l Red-Yellow -b 2.3,4</pre>

<a name="new"></a><p><hr><H2>What's new in this version</H2>

<p><b>v1.1</b>

<p>This version switched the nonlinear registration from using IRTK to
  using <a href=../fnirt/index.html>FNIRT</a> (FMRIB's Nonlinear
  Registration Tool) and as a result there are some minor usage
  changes. FNIRT is about 10-15 times faster than IRTK on structural
  data and possibly a little more 'accurate'. An FSL-VBM v1.1 analysis
  is <b>not</b> compatible with an older analysis.

<p>tbss_1_preproc is no longer used.

<p>FAST4 is now used for segmentation instead of FAST3.

<p><b>v1.0</b>
