    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The 3D viewer uses a set of stock VTK display elements to allow
      the user to view, and manipulate, the selected images. There is
      a main display showing each volume according to their designated
      display intent (modifiable via the <i>Image Type</i> control of
      the <a href="imageinfo.html">Layer Information Dialog</a>) as
      follows:</p>
      
    <table cellspacing="20">
      <tr><th>Unknown</th><td>Not displayed</td></tr>
      <tr><th>Main image</th><td>Displayed as a surface with
	  optional cut-aways to reveal the image data and any other
	  images within.</td></tr>
      <tr><th>Mask/Label</th><td>The image is displayed as a surface
	  with the label value at each appropriate vertex which will
	  appear to be a group of surfaces, one per label, coloured
	  according to the label value for the given
	  region.</td></tr>
      <tr><th>Statistic</th><td>The statistical data is blended into the main image so that it appears on the surface of the cut-away planes. </td></tr>
      <tr><th>Diffusion tensor</th><td>Not displayed</td></tr>
    </table>
