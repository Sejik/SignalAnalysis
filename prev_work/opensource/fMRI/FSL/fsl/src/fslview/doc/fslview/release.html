<h4>New Features</h4>

<ul> 
  <li>New "View Options Dialog" allows customization of the following behaviours:

    <ol>
      <li>Views now have an independent "cursor" which can optionally
	be linked to other views via a "global cursor".</li>
      <li>The volume index can locally be linked/unlinked across the
	displayed images.</li>
      <li>The onscreen cursor representation has a one voxel gap in
	the centre. This can be changed using the dialog.</li>
      <li>Orientation labels can be turned off/on.</li>
      <li>Each slice plane can be annotated with it's voxel, or mm,
	plane location.</li>
      <li>The frame rate for "movie loops" or other animations can now
	be adjusted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>The layer restrictions which meant that 4D images needed to be
    loaded before 3D ones is now lifted, i.e., you can now load a 3D
    image, add a 4D layer, and still be able to navigate the time
    dimension of the 4D layer.</li>
  <li>Timeseries display and FEAT model plotting are now better
    integrated so that you can choose which combinations of 4D layer
    and compatible models get shown.</li>
  <li>Lightbox mode only shows the cursor in the active slice view.</li>

  <li>Printing and SnapShots
    <ol>
      <li>The main views can be snapshot to a PNG file - click on the
	camera tool button. It's still just a snapshot so make your
	image big on screen to improve the quality.</li>
      <li>Timeseries plots now have a print button which works the same
	as the histogram plot. </li> 
    </ol></li>

  <li>Improved command line options
    <ol>
      <li>Can now specify several startup views using, e.g, <kbd>fslview --mode=lightbox,3d ...</kbd></li>
      <li>You can also specify the strating transparency value for each image</li>
    </ol></li>

  <li>In the ortho view one can now toggle slice arrangement between
    the conventional layout, three-in-a-row, and three-in-a-column
    layouts.  

  <li>Newly cloned mask images always start with a Red-Yellow color
    map.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Can now turn off second (negative) colourmap.</li>
  <li>Image used for neg lut rendering not linked to current volume number.</li>
  <li>Overlay layer widget correctly reflects which volume is being displayed.</li>
  <li>4D timeseries FEAT model viewing showed filtered_func_data
    timecourses regardless of which 4D image was selected and,
    consequently, the wrong data for the reported image was being
    displayed.</li>
</ul>
