    <h3>3D properties dialog</h3>

    <p>The dialog has two sections: "Basic" - dealing with lighting
      and surface colouring; and "Advanced" which allows the user to
      tune some of the parameters used to determine the shape of the
      extracted surface mesh. Usually the surface in question is being
      determined from a segmented brain and is intended to approximate
      the "pial" surface.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h4>The basic settings</h4>

    <table cellspacing="10">
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>Interpolation</b> Changes how the shading of
	      vertices is calculated. Possible options are: Flat,
	      Gouraud and Phong. In most cases Gouraud is the most
	      appropriate setting.</li>

	    <li><b>Ambient</b> Determines the percieved intensity of
	      the main light source.</li>

	    <li><b>Diffuse</b> This controls how much of the ambient
	      light is scattered back to the observer and other
	      objects in the scene. Larger values add substance in the
	      form of shadows and detail.</li>

	    <li><b>Opacity</b> Controls how opaque the surface will be
	      rendered. You can also modify opacity via the slider on
	      the <a href="imagelist.html">layer list</a>
	      panel.</li>
	    
	    <li><b>Specular</b> The intensity of the light reflected from
	      the surface of a shiny object.</li>

	    <li><b>Specular power</b> How shiny the object
	      is. Increasing this value will give the object smaller
	      highlights as they become less diffuse.</li>

	    <li><b>Surface Colour</b> These controls allow you to
	      change the colour of the surface representing the main
	      image.</li>
	  </ul>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Advanced settings</h4>

    <p>These settings determine how the pial surface is
      rendered. Modifying these values allow you to customize the look
      of the main images surface representation.</p>

    <table cellspacing="10">
      <tr>
	<td>  
	  <img src="3D-dialog-advanced.png" width="300">
	</td>
	<td>
	  <li><b>Gaussian: SD</b> Sets the standard deviation of the
	    smoothing kernel applied to the main surface.</li>

	  <li><b>Gaussian: radius</b>  Sets the radius of the
	    smoothing kernel applied to the main surface.</li>

	  <li><b>Marching Cubes: threshold</b> The upper threshold of
	    the marching cubes algorithm. Higher values generate deeper
	    sulci.</li>

	  <li><b>SmoothPolyDataFilter: iterations</b> For each vertex
	    v, the coordinates of v are modified according to an average
	    of the connected vertices. The number of iterations determines the
	    smoothness, i.e., the higher the number the smoother the
	    resultant surface.</li>

	  <li><b>SmoothPolyDataFilter: relaxation factor</b> Controls the
	    amount of displacement possible during each iteration of the
	    algorithm.</li>

	  <li><b>PolyDataNormals: feature angle</b> Used to control
	    the angle at which the algorithm defines an edge as
	    "sharp". When sharp edges are present, the edges are split
	    and new points generated to prevent blurry edges (due to
	    Gouraud shading).</li>
