    <h3>Anatomical atlas tools</h3>

    <p>These tools provide feedback via various <a
      href="../data/atlas-descriptions.html">atlases</a> included in the
      FSL/FSLView distributions. Labels from selected atlases can be
      displayed, summary images overlaid, structures located and
      single structure probabilty maps shown.</p>

      <p>Most of the atlases are <i>probabilistic</i>, which means
      that each structure in the atlas is represented as a standard
      space image with values from 0:100, according to the
      cross-population probability of a given voxel being in that
      structure. You can view individual structures' probability
      images via the <b>Structures...</b> button. In addition, each
      probabilistic atlas has been reduced to a single summary image
      for ease of display, where each voxel is colour-coded according
      to the most-probable structure; these images can be turned on
      via the <b>Atlases...</b> button.</p>
