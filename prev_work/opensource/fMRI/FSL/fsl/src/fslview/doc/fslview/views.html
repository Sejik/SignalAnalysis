    <h3>The image views</h3>
    


    <p>Images can be displayed using several kinds of 2 &amp; 3-D views, selectable via
    the <i>Tools</i> menu:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a name="view">Orthographic</a> - the default view showing one slice each of:
	axial; coronal and sagittal planes.
      <li>Lightbox - showing all axial slices simultaneously.
      <li>Single - shows only a single slice - the orientation can be
	switched between axial, coronal and sagittal.
    </ul>

    <p>Here we can see a typical view, "Ortho view", with the default set of toolbars enabled:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="mode.html">"Mode" toolbar</a> <font color="red">(1)</font>
	      determining how the cursor behaves.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="viewtool.html">"View" toolbar</a><font color="red">(2)</font> can be used to
	      animate/re-orient certain views.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="bricon.html">"BriCon" control</a><font color="red">(3)</font> for adjusting the way
	      voxel intensities get mapped to colours on screen.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The "Slice" views<font color="red">(4)</font> which render the images as
	      single slices and provide cursor input via the mouse.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="cursor.html">"Cursor" tool</a><font color="red">(5)</font> which
	      provides control and feedback via the cursor position.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="imagelist.html">"Layer"
		tool</a><font color="red">(6)</font> used to control the
	      order and individual properties of each layer to be
	      draw.
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	</td>
	<td>
	  <img width="500" src="view-ortho.png">
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>You can open as many views as you like (although the
      viewer might get a little slow if you open too many). This
      includes opening more than one instance of any given type
      - for example, you might want to start with
      the <i>Ortho</i> view, then open another <i>Ortho</i>
      view, in which you have different images from
      the <a name="imagelist" href="imagelist.html">Layer
	List</a> turned on, so that you can move the cursor around
      in the volume and compare different images
      (<a href="twoorthos.png">see example</a>). If you close
      down all views then all loaded images will be discarded
      and you will have to re-open a file to start viewing
      again.</p>

    <p>If you end up with too many open sub-windows to keep
      track of, <i>Window -> Tile</i> will auto-arrange them so
      that they are all visible simultaneously, and <i>Window ->
	Cascade</i> will place all sub-windows in a diagonal
      overlapping line, for you to select and adjust those of
      interest.</p>

    <p> Moving the mouse over a slice while holding down the left
      mouse button will cause the cursor to move around the image.
      The cursor position and value can be viewed on
      the <a href="cursor.html">Cursor Toolbar</a>.  It is also
      possible to move the cursor to any position by altering the
      values in the <a href="cursor.html">Cursor Toolbar</a>.  FSLView
      has "linked cursor" behaviour: as the cursor is moved around in
      one view it also moves in all other views. Visit the "View
      Options" dialog to turn on/off the linked cursor as needed.</p>
