--------------------------------

Version 1 - 16/12/2002

image display: 
	lightbox (all slices)
	ortho (three orthogonal views)
control of: 
	zoom,
	translation,
	intensity,
	contrast

image information display when cursor clicked: 
	voxel coords, 
	mm coords, 
	voxel intensity

dual display of two images (for purposes of evaluating: stats overlay,
registration quality, segmentation quality) - all methods:
	colour overlay eg of 1 or 2 stats images onto underlying image
	two displays, 
	linked cursors,
        like mni "register"

4D data: 
	associate a 3D image with a 4D dataset; 
	click in image and view timeseries.
  	view more than one time series at a time...or a grid of ts views

histogram display

movies of:
	slices through a volume or 
	slices (or 3-ortho-views) through 4D

--------------------------------

Version 2 - Summer 2003

tweaks from version 1

ROIs
  mask painting
  simple "graphics" at least cuboids
  thresholding / map pixels  -> connected components

image summary stats computing
  selectivity via thresholds or ROI

dual display options
	colour edges from one image onto another
	chequerboard
	shading like Rueckert's program

4D data: associate a 3D image with a 4D dataset; click in image and
view timeseries.
  also via XFMs including (later) warps.
  for FMRI results, plot timeseries vs fitted model.

FileManager and LookUpTable classes moved to Storage directory.

--------------------------------

Version 3 - bteot

histogram fitting
ROI stuff
  region filling
  edge following
volume rotations (interactive)	&re-ordering axes
3D surface rendering
call certain fslview functionaloiy  from command line (eg offline
rendering)
and vice versa
processing functions
	fslmaths
	ip
