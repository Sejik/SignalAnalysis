<h3>Viewing DTI Images</h3>
      
<p>Certain DTI image files (e.g., V1, the vector image showing the
principal diffusion tensor direction) are multi-volume (4D), like FMRI
image files. To view such images in <i>DTI Mode</i>, select the image
in the <a href="imagelist.html">Image List</a> and press the <i>Image
Info</i> button <img valign=middle src="info.png">.  This will open
the <a href="imageinfo.html">Image Info</a> dialog.

<p>In the <i>DTI Display options</i> section, change the value from
<i>None</i> to <i>Lines </i> or <i>RGB</i>. When <i>Lines</i> is set
the DTI vectors are expressed by the direction of many small
lines.

<p>When <i>RGB</i> is set the DTI vectors are expressed by colours
where Red, Green and Blue represent the x,y and z diffusion directions
respectively.  Colours such as purple are mixes of red, green and blue
and therefore express vectors that have significant nonzero components
in more than one of the x,y,z directions.

<p>Also, when DTI Display is set to <i>RGB</i> the image intensity can
be modulated, e.g. with the fractional anisotropy image. To do this,
load the FA image into FSLView and then select this in the
<i>Modulation</i> menu on the <a href="imageinfo.html">Image Info</a>
dialog. The DTI image will now be modulated by the anisotropy
image. Where anisotropy values are very low the DTI image will appear
more transparent. Where the anisotropy are very high the DTI image
will appear more opaque.  When the DTI image is highlighted in the
<i>Image List</i> the transparency slider will split into 2 parts. The
left hand slider controls the overall transparency. The right hand
slider controls the amount of transparency change caused by the
modulation. If the right hand slider is set to the furthest point on
the right then the modulation will have no effect at all.
