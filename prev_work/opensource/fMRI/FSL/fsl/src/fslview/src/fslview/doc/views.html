<h3>Different image views</h3>
      
<p>The images can be viewed in 3 kinds of of view, via the <i
>View</i> menu:

<ul>

<li>Ortho - the default view showing axial, orthogonal and sagittal slices.

<li>Lightbox - shows all axial slices simultaneously.

<li>Single - shows only a single slice - the orientation can be
switched between axial, orthogonal and sagittal <img valign=middle
src="viewdir.png"> and you can also turn on auto-scrolling through the
slices <img valign=middle src="autoscroll.png">.

</ul>

<p>You can open as many views as you like (though the viewer will get
rather slow if you open too many). This includes opening more than one
instance of any given type - for example, you might want to start with
the <i>Ortho</i> view, then open another <i>Ortho</i> view, in which
you have different images from the <a href="imagelist.html">Image
List</a> turned on, so that you can move the cursor around in the
volume and compare different images (<a href="twoorthos.png">see
example</a>). If you close down all views then all loaded images will
be discarded and you will have to re-open a file to start viewing
again.

<p>If you end up with too many open sub-windows to keep track of,
<i>Window -> Tile</i> will auto-arrange them so that they are all
visible simultaneously, and <i>Window -> Cascade</i> will place all
sub-windows in a diagonal overlapping line, for you to select and
adjust those of interest.

<p> Moving the mouse over a slice while holding down the left mouse
button will cause the cursor to move around the image.  The cursor
position and value can be viewed on the <a href="cursor.html">Cursor
Toolbar</a>.  It is also possible to move the cursor to any position
by altering the values in the <a href="cursor.html">Cursor
Toolbar</a>.  FSLView has "linked cursor" behaviour: as the cursor is
moved around in one view it also moves in all other views.
