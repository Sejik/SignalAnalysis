<h3>Image Info</h3>

<p>To view information about an image, select the image in the <a
href="imagelist.html">Image List</a> and press the <i >Image
Info</i>) button <img alt="picture" src="info.png">.

<p><table border="1" cellpadding="10">

<tr>
<td>Name:
<td>Name of the image; can be edited (e.g. to disambiguate two image
of the same name)
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Filename:
<td>Original filename of image
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Voxels:
<td>3D image matrix size (number of voxels in X, Y & Z)
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dimensions:
<td>Dimensions (size) of a single voxel (mm)
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Volumes:
<td>Size of the image in the 4th dimension (e.g. time)
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Data type:
<td>Data type the voxel intensity is represented in (floating point,
integer etc.)
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Image type:
<td>Type of image (e.g. z-statistic) - not many images have this flag
set yet
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lookup table options
<td>Controls the greyscale or colour-scale lookup table used. Press
the file selector for a LUT file not already on the menus. If the
second LUT is activated (by turning on the checkbox), this is used for
negative values, and the first LUT is used for positive values. In
this case the bricon controls are set wrt the first LUT and should
therefore be positive values (the same range, but negative, is then
used for the second LUT).

<tr>
<td>DTI display options
<td>Selects <a href="dti.html">DTI image display mode</a>. Can be RGB or Lines.

<!-- <p>FSLView is able deal with LUTs of more than one type. If a LUT file -->
<!-- has a .lut extension the loaded lut colours will be allocated to -->
<!-- values between the minimum and maximum voxel intensity. If a LUT file -->
<!-- has a .rgb extension the loaded lut colours will be allocated to -->
<!-- absolute voxel values. Using .rgb types of LUTs allows anatomical -->
<!-- features to be displayed in predefined colours. -->
          
<!--           <p> -->
<!--             Examples of LUT files for users to download and edit:- -->
          
<!--           <p> -->
<!--             The three numbers in the .lut file refer to red, green and blue intensities  -->
<!--             where 0.0 is the minimum intensity and 1.0 is the maximum intensity. -->

<!--           <p> -->
<!--             The first number in the .rgb file is the intensity the colour is paired with. -->
<!--             Then there is a string for describing the feature, eg Hippocampus. -->
<!--             There then follow three numbers expressing the RGB colour intensities where -->
<!--             0 is the minimum and 255 is the maximum. The fourth number is not used in -->
<!--             Fslview, it can just be set to zero. -->
