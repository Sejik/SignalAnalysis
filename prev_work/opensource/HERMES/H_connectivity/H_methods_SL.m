function RESULT = H_sl( X, config)

% DESCRIPTION
% This function takes in data from the file s_in or variable X_in
% (if not given, then a prompt appears asking for filename)
% and outputs the synchronization likelihood in three files,
% 'synchro.txt', 'syntime.txt', 'marnhold.txt', unless specified.
%

% TO CHANGE PARAMETERS, DO A SEARCH FOR "SETTINGS", CASE SENSITIVE!
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

% input data source
%       The input data file must contain M columns and N rows of numbers.  These numbers
%       correspond to the N samples for each of the M channels.
% (if s_in/X_in is not given, then there will be a prompt asking for the input file.)
%
% synchro.txt
%         This file will contain the synchronization likelihood of each channel, compared
%         with *all* other channels.  The output will contain M columns and T rows of
%         numbers.
%
% syntime.txt
%         This file contains the *overall* synchronization likelihood of the signals
%         at each time t.  The output will contain 1 column and T rows of numbers.
%
% marnhold.txt
%         This file contains an MxM matrix, which corresponds to an alternative time-averaged
%         calculation of synchronization values.  In position (X,Y), the value represents
%         the *harmonic average* of the synchronization likelihood of X to Y & Y to X.
%

% NOTE (marnhold.txt):
%         The actual calculation is: 2 * ( # X&Y are hit ) / ( #X-hits + # Y-hits ), which
%         is the harmonic average of ( # X-hit )/( # X&Y are hit ) and
%                                    ( # Y-hit )/( # X&Y are hit )
%
%         where #hits is the total number of hits across time.
%

% DEVIATIONS from synchronization(.) procedure (i.e. the "Pascal code")
% 1. The variable w has been changed to w1, to correspond with the articles.
% 2. The variable w2 has been redefined, to correspond with the articles.
%     This change alters the result slightly with the Pascal code; in the Pascal code,
%     w2 approximately represented the fraction of the total number of samples, and in
%     one instance is hardcoded as 0.1.  Also, the total number of samples was
%     calculated in two different manners, yielding two different results.
%     These discrepancies have been eliminated in this implementation.  w2 is the actual
%     integer number that represents the upper bound of the window, as in the articles.
% 3. The chanbias & actchan variables have been eliminated!  The result from using
%     chanbias & actchan can be obtained from the S_matrix variable:
%        S_matrix(:,actchan,:)
%     That is, if chanbias is used, then we are considering how all the other channels
%     relate as *driver systems* to the *response system* actchan-channel.
% 4. The ranges for i & j is now 1 : m2 - l*(m-1), instead of 1 : m2 - l*m.
%     The last element of X_{k,m2-l*(m-1)} will use the last element X_{k,m2} in the calculation.
% 5. The calculation of epsilons is different; it is now closer to pref.
%
% Note: (26.06.03) S_matrix is now an internal variable. Use the sync_gui.m program
%     to manipulate the S_matrix variable.
%

% A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO THE SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD MEASURE
%
% We define the SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD for a driver system X and a response system Y.
% 
% PROPERTY (*): If X is in the same state at times i & j, then Y is also in the same state at times i & j.
%
% Generalized synchronization exists when property (*) holds.
% If X & Y exhibit property (*), then the synchronization likelihood between X and Y will be high.
%
% State (def'n): Given l (lag) and m (embedding dimension), the state of X at time i is defined
%  as the vector X_i = ( x_{i}, x_{i+l}, x_{i+2l}, ..., x_{i+(m-1)l} )
%
% Similarity between states (def'n): Two states X_i and X_j are similar if the distance between
%  X_i and X_j is small.  We use the euclidean distance measure (the L2 norm of the vector difference).
%
%
% To have a measure of similarity, we construct an epsilon that depends on the system (X) and time (i).
% We will define that similarity exists if |X_i - X_j| < epsilon_{X,i}.
%
% To determine epsilon_{X,i}, we consider the set of X_j for all j satisfying w1<|i-j|<w2.  From this set,
% we then determine the set of distances between X_i and all X_j.  We then choose epsilon_{X,i} as the
% distance so that the fraction of distances |X_i - X_j| less than epsilon_{X,i} is Pref.
%
% We calculate epsilon_{Y,i} in a similar manner, *using the same Pref* (and same time i).
%
% Now, with i fixed, for each of the values j satisfying w1<|i-j|<w2, we consider a hit wrt X occurs
% (at time j) when |X_i - X_j| < epsilon_{X,i}.  A hit wrt Y occurs when |Y_i - Y_j| < epsilon_{Y,i}.
%
% The synchronization likelihood is defined as the probability (over the valid j's) that
%  there is a hit wrt Y, *given* that there is a hit wrt X.
%
% That is, S(x,y,i) = (# of times there is a hit wrt X and a hit wrt Y) / (# of hits wrt X).
%
%
% If there is no synchronization between X & Y, then the synchronization likelihood is close to Pref.
% If there is synchronization between X & Y, then the synchronization likelihood will approach 1.
%
% Once the whole set of S(x,y,i) is constructed, we can construct variations by averaging over one or
%  more of the three axes (driver system, response system, time).
%
% "Averaging over all [axes] gives S, the overall level of synchronization in a multi channel epoch."
