function [ bic, aic ] = cca_find_model_order ( data, minP, maxP )
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% FUNCTION: cca_find_model_order.m
% PURPOSE:  use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and/or the Aikaike
%           Information Criterion to find the best model order (NLAGS)
%           for a multivariate data set.
% 
% INPUTS:   X: matrix of nvar variables by nobs observations of each variable by trials
%           MINP: minimum model order to consider
%           MAXP: maximum model order to consider
%
% OUTPUT:   bic: optimal model order according to BIC
%           aic: optimal model order according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
