eConnectome 2.0 is released! 
Please visit http://econnectome.umn.edu to download the new version. 

This is the 2.0 version of eConnectome, which includes the EEG/MEG/ECoG functional connectivity modules.s. 

The MEG connectivity analysis module was implemented and included in the new version. 
The main functionality of the MEG connectivity analysis module includes:   
(1) Preprocessing of multi-channel MEG data, including filtering, baseline correction, 
    bad channel rejection, time-frequency representation, power spectral density analysis, 
    field mapping, spectral mapping, ERF analysis etc.

(2) Estimation of directional connectivity among multi-channel MEG sensors based on the
    Directed Transfer Function (DTF) or Adaptive DTF (ADTF) method, and visualization of 
    the directional connectivity over the MEG sensor surface.

(3) Cortical current sources can be reconstructed from MEG data. 
    Besides a standard geometry model from the MNI brain, an individual BEM model with 
    the relative lead field matrix can be used for cortical source imaging. 

(4) Directional connectivity among selected cortical ROIs can be estimated with the DTF or ADTF 
    method and visualized over the cortex model.
