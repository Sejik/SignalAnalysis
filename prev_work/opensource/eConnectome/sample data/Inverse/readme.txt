Sensor.mat stores the EEG potential map on the scalp model or MEG field map on the cap surface (exported from the 'Cortical Source Imaging' GUI).

Source.mat stores the imaged cortical sources on the cortex model (exported from the 'Cortical Source Imaging' GUI). 

Please save the sensor/source maps to Sensor.mat/Source.mat (the file names Sensor/Source can be customized, e.g. ABC/DEF)

Individual-BEM-Model.mat is an example of the structure of individual BEM model. 
The individual BEM model corresponds to the simulated EEG data set in ' \eConnectome\sample data\EEG\Simulation '.
