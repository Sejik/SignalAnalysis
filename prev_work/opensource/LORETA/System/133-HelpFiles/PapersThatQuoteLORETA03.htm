<li>Sherlin L, Budzynski T, Kogan Budzynski H, Congedo M, Fischer ME, Buchwald D: Low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (loreta) of monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue syndrome. NeuroImage 2007;34:1438-1442.<p>
Summary: Background: Previous work using quantified EEG has suggested that brain activity in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and normal persons differs. Our objective was to investigate if specific frequency band-pass regions and spatial locations are associated with CFS using low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (LORETA). Methods: We conducted a co-twin control study of 17 pairs of monozygotic twins where 1 twin met criteria for CFS and the co-twin was healthy. Twins underwent an extensive battery of tests including a structured psychiatric interview and a quantified EEG. Eyes closed EEG frequency-domain analysis was computed and the entire brain volume was compared of the CFS and healthy twins using a multiple comparison procedure. Results: Compared with their healthy co-twins, twins with CFS differed in current source density. The CFS twins had higher delta in the left uncus and parahippocampal gyrus and higher theta in the cingulate gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: These findings suggest that neurophysiological activity in specific areas of the brain may differentiate individuals with CFS from those in good health. The study corroborates that slowing of the deeper structures of the limbic system is associated with affect. It also supports the neurobiological model that the right forebrain is associated with sympathetic activity and the left forebrain with the effective management of energy.

Summary: Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a functional deterioration of the fronto-temporo-parietal network of the right hemispheric vigilance system in narcolepsy and a therapeutic effect of modafinil. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Rippon G, Brock J, Brown C, Boucher J: Disordered connectivity in the autistic brain: Challenges for the 'new psychophysiology'. International Journal of Psychophysiology 2007;63:164-172.<p>
Summary: In 2002, we published a paper [Brock, J., Brown, C., Boucher, J., Rippon, G., 2002. The temporal binding deficit hypothesis of autism. Development and Psychopathology 142, 209-224] highlighting the parallels between the psychological model of 'central coherence' in information processing [Frith, U., 1989. Autism: Explaining the Enigma. Blackwell, Oxford] and the neuroscience model of neural integration or 'temporal binding'. We proposed that autism is associated with abnormalities of information integration that is caused by a reduction in the connectivity between specialised local neural networks in the brain and possible overconnectivity within the isolated individual neural assemblies. The current paper updates this model, providing a summary of theoretical and empirical advances in research implicating disordered connectivity in autism. This is in the context of changes in the approach to the core psychological deficits in autism, of greater emphasis on 'interactive specialisation' and the resultant stress on early and/or low-level deficits and their cascading effects on the developing brain [Johnson, M.H., Halit, H., Grice, S.J., Karmiloff-Smith, A., 2002. Neuroimaging of typical and atypical development: a perspective from multiple levels of analysis. Development and Psychopathology 14, 521-536].We also highlight recent developments in the measurement and modelling of connectivity, particularly in the emerging ability to track the temporal dynamics of the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and to investigate the signal characteristics of this activity. This advance could be particularly pertinent in testing an emerging model of effective connectivity based on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cortical activity [Rubenstein, J.L., Merzenich M.M., 2003. Model of autism: increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in key neural systems. Genes, Brain and Behavior 2, 255-267; Brown, C., Gruber, T., Rippon, G., Brock, J., Boucher, J., 2005. Gamma abnormalities during perception of illusory figures in autism. Cortex 41, 364-376]. Finally, we note that the consequence of this convergence of research developments not only enables a greater understanding of autism but also has implications for prevention and remediation. © 2006.<p>

Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry 2007;31:234-241.<p>
Summary: Objective: The P600 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting the 'rule-governed sequence of information processing', has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related cognition. The present study aimed at examining the effects of methylprednisolone treatment in MS patients on cognition as reflected by the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) of the P600 as well as its conventional constituents (amplitudes and latencies) recorded during a working memory (WM) test. Method: A paired LORETA comparison was performed in the P600 component of ERPs elicited during a (WM) test in 18 MS patients suffering from the relapsing-remitting form, before and after 1 week treatment with methylprednisolone. The P600 component was also evaluated in 16 healthy controls matched to the patients on age and educational level. Results: When pre- and post-treatment recordings of LORETA were compared all patients as a group showed significantly different patterns of current density activation located at right frontal lobe. The treatment was accompanied by an increase of the amplitude of P600 at the right frontoparietal area. In the post-treatment phase the patients exhibited significant improvement of the memory performance as compared to themselves before treatment. As a result both the P600 amplitudes and memory performance at post-treatment were closer to those exhibited by normal controls. Conclusion: These findings support the notion that steroid treatment in relapsing-remitting MS patients, may exert a beneficial effect in 'rule-governed sequence of information processing'. © 2006.<p>

Summary: Background: Two promising approaches have been introduced for the prediction of treatment response in major depression: one concept is based on the activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Subjects with higher metabolic rates respond better to sleep deprivation or antidepressive medication. Another approach is the investigation of the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP). Here, a high LDAEP is supposed to reflect low central serotonergic activity. We present the first study comparing both approaches in the same group of patients. Methods: Patients with major depression (n = 20) were investigated using both resting EEG and LDAEP before treatment with either citalopram or reboxetine. Results: We found significant differences between responders and non-responders in the rACC in the theta-frequency range (6.5-8 Hz, p &lt; 0.05). In the subgroup of patients, treated with citalopram we found higher LDAEP-values in responders versus non-responders (p &lt; 0.05) and a significant correlation between pre-treatment-LDAEP and improvement in the Hamilton score after treatment (r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: In combining both methods a prediction whether a patient with major depression might be at risk for non-response to a standard therapy as well as a suggestion for a pharmacological approach of choice seems to be possible. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

<li>Im CH: Dealing with mismatched fmri activations in fmri constrained eeg cortical source imaging: A simulation study assuming various mismatch types. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 2007;45:79-90.<p>
Summary: Although fMRI constrained EEG source imaging could be a promising approach to enhancing both spatial and temporal resolutions of independent fMRI and EEG analyses, it has been frequently reported that a hard fMRI constraint may cause severe distortion or elimination of significant EEG sources when there are distinct mismatches between fMRI activations and EEG sources. If estimating actual EEG source locations is important and fMRI prior information is used as an auxiliary tool to enhance the concentration of widespread EEG source distributions, it is reasonable to weaken the fMRI constraint when significantly mismatched sources exist. The present study demonstrates that the mismatch problem may be partially solved by extending the prior fMRI activation regions based on the conventional source imaging results. A hard fMRI constraint is then applied when there is no distinct mismatch, while a weakened fMRI constraint is applied when there are significant mismatches. A preliminary simulation study assuming different types of mismatches such as fMRI invisible, extra, and discrepancy sources demonstrated that this approach can be a promising option to treat mismatched fMRI activations in fMRI constrained EEG source imaging. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2006.<p>

<li>Hsiao JHw, Shillcock R, Lee Cy: Neural correlates of foveal splitting in reading: Evidence from an erp study of chinese character recognition. Neuropsychologia 2007;45:1280-1292.<p>
Summary: Recent research on foveal structure and reading suggests that the two halves of a centrally fixated word seem to be initially projected to, and processed in, different hemispheres. In the current study, we utilize two contrasting structures in Chinese orthography, &quot;SP&quot; (the semantic radical on the left and the phonetic radical on the right) and &quot;PS&quot; characters (the opposite structure), to examine foveal splitting effects in event-related potential (ERP) recordings. We showed that when participants silently named centrally presented characters, there was a significant interaction between character type and hemisphere in N1 amplitude: SP characters elicited larger N1 compared with PS characters in the left hemisphere, whereas the right hemisphere had the opposite pattern. This effect is consistent with the split fovea claim, suggesting that the two halves of a character may be initially projected to and processed in different hemispheres. There was no such interaction observed in an earlier component P1. Also, there was an interaction between character type and sex of the reader in N350 amplitude. This result is consistent with Hsiao and Shillcock's [Hsiao, J. H., &amp; Shillcock, R. (2005b). Foveal splitting causes differential processing of Chinese orthography in the male and female brain. Cognitive Brain Research, 25, 531-536] behavioural study, which showed a similar interaction in naming response time. They argued that this effect was due to a more left-lateralized network for phonological processing in the male brain compared with the female brain. The results hence showed that foveal splitting effects in visual word recognition were observed in N1 the earliest, and could extend far enough to interact with the sex of the reader as revealed in N350. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

<li>Horev N, Most T, Pratt H: Categorical perception of speech (vot) and analogous non-speech (fot) signals: Behavioral and electrophysiological correlates. Ear and Hearing 2007;28:111-128.<p>
Summary: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether voicing perception is influenced primarily by linguistic experience or if it is due to innate temporal sensitivity to voicing boundaries, by examining behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of speech Voice-Onset-Time (VOT) and nonspeech Formant-Onset-Time (FOT) categorical perception. DESIGN: Behavioral measures and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from 14 normal-hearing Hebrew speakers, whose voicing distinction is different than English, during identification and discrimination of two sets of stimuli: a VOT continuum, created by editing natural productions of /ba/ and /pa/, and an analogous nonspeech continuum, composed of two synthesized formants, varying in their onset time-FOT. RESULTS: VOT and FOT continua yielded similar behavioral identification curves. Differences between the two stimulus types were found in discrimination of within-category differences and in reaction time effects. During identification and discrimination tasks, ERPs were differently affected by the VOT or FOT value of the stimulus: VOT value had a significant effect on N1 latency and on N1 and P2 amplitudes whereas FOT value had a significant effect on P2 amplitude. Additionally, during identification tasks, whereas all speech signals evoked a P3, regardless of overt categorization, only the perceptually &quot;rare&quot; nonspeech stimulus (+15 msec FOT) evoked a P3. CONCLUSIONS: Voicing boundaries corresponded to Hebrew VOT values of production, suggesting that voicing perception in Hebrew is mediated mainly by linguistic experience rather than by innate temporal sensitivity. ERP data differed to VOT versus FOT stimuli as early as N1, indicating that brain processing of the temporal aspects of speech and nonspeech signals differ from their early stages. Further studies to establish the neural response patterns to voicing in speakers of languages that use different voicing categories than English are warranted. © 2007 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Inc.<p>

<li>Hanslmayr S, Klimesch W, Sauseng P, Gruber W, Doppelmayr M, Freunberger R, Pecherstorfer T, Birbaumer N: Alpha phase reset contributes to the generation of erps. Cerebral Cortex 2007;17:1-8.<p>
Summary: An unresolved question in electroencephalogram (EEG) research is whether event-related potentials (ERPs) are generated by phase-reset or evoked response. We analyzed data of a visual feature detection task and will show 1) phase concentration in the alpha frequency range, 2) ongoing alpha activity prior to stimulus onset, 3) evoked alpha oscillation in the ERP, 4) lack of power increase during phase concentration, 5) decrease in amplitude variance during early evoked components preceding a decrease in power, and 6) the same cortical sources for induced prestimulus power and evoked poststimulus power. Because none of these data provide unequivocal evidence for phase reset, we additionally tested the basic assumption of the evoked model, which is the additivity of the evoked response on the basis of a simulation approach. Our findings suggest that nonadditive processes - typical for a phase reset - are involved in the generation of the ERP. Thus, together with the other findings this study provides unequivocal evidence for phase resetting in the human EEG. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press.

<li>Halder P, Brem S, Bucher K, Boujraf S, Summers P, Dietrich T, Kollias S, Martin E, Brandeis D: Electrophysiological and hemodynamic evidence for late maturation of hand power grip and force control under visual feedback. Human Brain Mapping 2007;28:69-84.<p>
Summary: Several human imaging studies have described the neural network involved in power grip under visual control and the subset of cortical areas within this network that are sensitive to force modulation. As there is behavioral evidence for late maturation in even simple hand motor tasks involving visual feedback, we aimed at identifying the neural correlates of these developmental changes. Subjects from three developmental age groups (9-11, 15-17, and adults) performed the same power grip task in both a functional magnetic resonance imaging and an event-related potential (ERP) session. Trials started with a visual target indicating whether to squeeze at 20%, 40%, or 75% of their maximum and online visual feedback on the actual amount of force was provided. Longer reaction times and more shallow slopes of the force curve characterized the behavior of the younger age groups, especially the children. Both neurophysiological methods detected both general as well as force modulation-specific maturational changes. General development was characterized by decreasing ERP amplitudes and increasing deactivation of an extended network, closely resembling the so-called &quot;default&quot; network. The most pronounced developmental changes specific for force control were observed in an ERP component and brain regions involved in feedback processing. In contrast to adult subjects, we found evidence for a stronger dependency on visual feedback information in the younger age groups. Our results also suggest that the ability to deactivate task-irrelevant networks might be a late developmental achievement. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Objective: To compare EEG power spectra and LORETA-computed intracortical activity between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls, and to correlate the results with cognitive performance in the AD group. Methods: Nineteen channel resting EEG was recorded in 21 mild to moderate AD patients and in 23 controls. Power spectra and intracortical LORETA tomography were computed in seven frequency bands and compared between groups. In the AD patients, the EEG results were correlated with cognitive performance (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE). Results: AD patients showed increased power in EEG delta and theta frequency bands, and decreased power in alpha2, beta1, beta2 and beta3. LORETA specified that increases and decreases of power affected different cortical areas while largely sparing prefrontal cortex. Delta power correlated negatively and alpha1 power positively with the AD patients' MMSE scores; LORETA tomography localized these correlations in left temporo-parietal cortex. Conclusions: The non-invasive EEG method of LORETA localized pathological cortical activity in our mild to moderate AD patients in agreement with the literature, and yielded striking correlations between EEG delta and alpha1 activity and MMSE scores in left temporo-parietal cortex. Significance: The present data support the hypothesis of an asymmetrical progression of the Alzheimer's disease. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.<p>

<li>Gallinat J, Go?tz T, Kalus P, Bajbouj M, Sander T, Winterer G: Genetic variations of the nr3a subunit of the nmda receptor modulate prefrontal cerebral activity in humans. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 2007;19:59-68.<p>
Summary: Introduction: Recently, a novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit, NR3A, has been discovered in the brain. This subunit decreases NMDA receptor activity by modulating the calcium permeability of the receptor channel and current density in cortical cells. Because the NR3A is expressed in the human prefrontal cortex, we hypothesized that genetic variations of the NR3A subunit modulate prefrontal activation. Methods: Electromagnetic activity during selective attention (auditory odd-ball task with target processing) was measured in 281 healthy subjects. Genotyping of a missense variation (rs10989591, Val362Met) of the NR3A gene was performed. Results: Individuals carrying Val/Val genotype showed significantly reduced frontal P300 amplitudes compared with Met/Met subjects. Subsequent low-resolution electromagnetic source analysis revealed that this group difference is likely caused by reduced activation in the inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: It was shown for the first time that the genetic constitution of the subunit composition of NMDA receptor regulation might be relevant for prefrontal information processing in humans. The results underline the pivotal role of glutamate in frontal lobe function and indicate that the NR3A subunit could be a plausible candidate gene for diseases with prefrontal dysfunctions. © 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<p>

<li>Ferri R, Rundo F, Bruni O, Terzano MG, Stam CJ: Small-world network organization of functional connectivity of eeg slow-wave activity during sleep. Clinical Neurophysiology 2007;118:449-456.<p>
Summary: Objective: To analyze the functional connectivity patterns of the EEG slow-wave activity during the different sleep stages and Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) conditions, using concepts derived from Graph Theory. Methods: We evaluated spatial patterns of EEG slow-wave synchronization between all possible pairs of electrodes (19) placed over the scalp of 10 sleeping healthy young normal subjects using two graph theoretical measures: the clustering coefficient (Cp) and the characteristic path length (Lp). The measures were obtained during the different sleep stages and CAP conditions from the real EEG connectivity networks and randomized control (surrogate) networks (Cp-s and Lp-s). Results: Cp and Cp/Cp-s increased significantly from wakefulness to sleep while Lp and Lp/Lp-s did not show changes. Cp/Cp-s was higher for A1 phases, compared to B phases of CAP. Conclusions: The network organization of the EEG slow-wave synchronization during sleep shows features characteristic of small-world networks (high Cp combined with low Lp); this type of organization is slightly but significantly more evident during the CAP A1 subtypes. Significance: Our results show feasibility of using graph theoretical measures to characterize the complexity of brain networks during sleep and might indicate sleep, and the A1 phases of CAP in particular, as a period during which slow-wave synchronization shows optimal network organization for information processing. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.<p>

<li>Ehlis AC, Reif A, Herrmann MJ, Lesch KP, Fallgatter AJ: Impact of catechol-o-methyltransferase on prefrontal brain functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Neuropsychopharmacology 2007;32:162-170.<p>
Summary: The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has attracted increasing interest regarding a genetic disposition towards schizophrenias and as a modulator of prefrontal brain function. A common SNP in the COMT gene causes a Val to Met transition at AA158/AA108 (Val158Met), resulting in reduced COMT activity in Met allele carriers. An impact of COMT genotype on cognition has been well established; however, the exact nature of this influence has yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine whether COMT genotype affects an electrophysiological marker of prefrontal activation and neuropsychological frontal lobe measures in schizophrenia. To this end, 56 acutely psychotic in-patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were investigated. Patients with the COMT 1947AA (Met/Met) genotype (n=13) were compared to a carefully matched sample of patients with a G1947A (Val/Met) genotype (n=15); matching criteria included patients' age, handedness, gender distribution, diagnosis, and medication status. A small group of six homozygous Val allele carriers was additionally included to allow an assessment of possible gene-dosage effects. P300 amplitudes and latencies, as well as an electrophysiological marker of prefrontal brain function (NoGo-Anteriorization/ NGA) and neuropsychological measures (Stroop Test, Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test) were regarded. Homozygous Met allele carriers had significantly increased NGA values and fronto-central Nogo amplitudes compared to patients with at least one Val allele. They also tended to perform better in the Stroop task, as compared to the matched group of Val/Met patients. These results indicate that COMT genotype exerts a strong impact on prefrontal functioning and executive control in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Ding L, Worrell GA, Lagerlund TD, He B: Ictal source analysis: Localization and imaging of causal interactions in humans. NeuroImage 2007;34:575-586.<p>
Summary: We propose a new integrative approach to characterize the structure of seizures in the space, time, and frequency domains. Such characterization leads to a new technical development of ictal source analysis for the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. The present new ictal source analysis method consists of three parts. First, a three-dimensional source scanning procedure is performed by a spatio-temporal FINE source localization method to locate the multiple sources responsible for the time evolving ictal rhythms at their onsets. Next, the dynamic behavior of the sources is modeled by a multivariate autoregressive process (MVAR). Lastly, the causal interaction patterns among the sources as a function of frequency are estimated from the MVAR modeling of the source temporal dynamics. The causal interaction patterns indicate the dynamic communications between sources, which are useful in distinguishing the primary sources responsible for the ictal onset from the secondary sources caused by the ictal propagation. The present ictal analysis strategy has been applied to a number of seizures from five epilepsy patients, and their results are consistent with observations from either MRI lesions or SPECT scans, which indicate its effectiveness. Each step of the ictal source analysis is statistically evaluated in order to guarantee the confidence in the results. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Cohen MX, Ranganath C: Reinforcement learning signals predict future decisions. Journal of Neuroscience 2007;27:371-378.<p>
Summary: Optimal behavior in a competitive world requires the flexibility to adapt decision strategies based on recent outcomes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that this flexibility emerges through a reinforcement learning process, in which reward prediction errors are used dynamically to adjust representations of decision options. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while subjects played a strategic economic game against a computer opponent to evaluate how neural responses to outcomes related to subsequent decision-making. Analyses of ERP data focused on the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an outcome-locked potential thought to reflect a neural prediction error signal. Consistent with predictions of a computational reinforcement learning model, we found that the magnitude of ERPs after losing to the computer opponent predicted whether subjects would change decision behavior on the subsequent trial. Furthermore, FRNs to decision outcomes were disproportionately larger over the motor cortex contralateral to the response hand that was used to make the decision. These findings provide novel evidence that humans engage a reinforcement learning process to adjust representations of competing decision options. Copyright © 2007 Society for Neuroscience.<p>

<li>Carretie L, Hinojosa JA, Lo?pez-Marti?n S, Tapia M: An electrophysiological study on the interaction between emotional content and spatial frequency of visual stimuli. Neuropsychologia 2007;45:1187-1195.<p>
Summary: Previous studies suggest that the magnocellular pathway, a visual processing system that rapidly provides low spatial frequency information to fast-responding structures such as the amygdala, is more involved in the processing of emotional facial expressions than the parvocellular pathway (which conveys all spatial frequencies). The present experiment explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spatial frequency modulation of affect-related neural processing, as well as its generalizability to non-facial stimuli. To that aim, the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by low-pass filtered (i.e., high spatial frequencies are eliminated) and intact non-facial emotional images were recorded from 31 participants using a 60-electrode array. The earliest significant effect of spatial frequency was observed at 135 ms from stimulus onset: N135 component of the ERPs. In line with previous studies, the origin of N135 was localized at secondary visual areas for low-pass filtered stimuli and at primary areas for intact stimuli. Importantly, this component showed an interaction between spatial frequency and emotional content: within low-pass filtered pictures, negative stimuli elicited the highest N135 amplitudes. By contrast, within intact stimuli, neutral pictures were those eliciting the highest amplitudes. These results suggest that high spatial frequencies are not essential for the initial affect-related processing of visual stimuli, which would mainly rely on low spatial frequency visual information. According to present data, high spatial frequencies would come into play later on. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Brookes MJ, Stevenson CM, Barnes GR, Hillebrand A, Simpson MIG, Francis ST, Morris PG: Beamformer reconstruction of correlated sources using a modified source model. NeuroImage 2007;34:1454-1465.<p>
Summary: This paper introduces a lead field formulation for use in beamformer analysis of MEG data. This 'dual source beamformer' is a technique to image two temporally correlated sources using beamformer methodology. We show that while the standard, single source beamformer suppresses the reconstructed power of two spatially separate but temporally correlated sources, the dual source beamformer allows for their accurate reconstruction. The technique is proven to be accurate using simulations. We also show that it can be used to image accurately the auditory steady state response, which is correlated between the left and right auditory cortices. We suggest that this technique represents a useful way of locating correlated sources, particularly if a seed location can be defined a priori for one of the two sources. Such a priori information could be based on previous studies using similar paradigms, or from other functional neuroimaging techniques. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Zumsteg D, Lozano AM, Wieser HG, Wennberg RA: Cortical activation with deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus for epilepsy. Clinical Neurophysiology 2006;117:192-207.<p>
Summary: Objective: We studied the relation between thalamic stimulation parameters and the morphology, topographic distribution and cortical sources of the cerebral responses in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus. Methods: Bipolar and monopolar stimuli were delivered at a rate of 2 Hz to the anterior (AN, four patients), the dorsomedian (DM, four patients), and the centromedian nucleus (CM, one patient) using the programmable stimulation device (Medtronic ITREL II). Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values. Results: All patients demonstrated reproducible time-locked cortical responses (CRs) consisting of a sequence of components with latencies between 20 and 320 ms. The morphology of these CRs, however, was very heterogeneous, depending primarily on the site of stimulation. Following AN stimulation, cortical activation was most prominent in ipsilateral cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and lateral neocortical temporal structures. Stimulation of the DM mainly showed activation of the ipsilateral orbitofrontal and mesial and lateral frontal areas, but also involvement of mesial temporal structures. Stimulation of the CM showed a rather diffuse (though still mainly ipsilateral) increase of cortical activity. The magnitude of cortical activation was positively related to the strength of the stimulus and inversely related to the impedance of the electrode. Conclusions: The pattern of cortical activation corresponded with the hodology of the involved structures and may underscore the importance of optimal localization of DBS electrodes in patients with epilepsy. Significance: The method of analyzing sources of CRs could potentially be a useful tool for titration of DBS parameters in patients with electrode contacts in clinically silent areas. Furthermore, the inverse relation of the cortical activation and the impedance of the electrode contacts might suggest that these impedance measurements should be taken into consideration when adjusting DBS parameters in patients with epilepsy. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Zumsteg D, Friedman A, Wieser HG, Wennberg RA: Source localization of interictal epileptiform discharges: Comparison of three different techniques to improve signal to noise ratio. Clinical Neurophysiology 2006;117:562-571.<p>
Summary: Objective: To investigate the localization accuracy of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for mesial temporal interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) using a new relative averaging (RELAVG) technique for noise reduction. Methods: We analyzed 19 patterns of mesial temporal IED recorded simultaneously with scalp and foramen ovale (FO) electrodes in 15 consecutive patients who underwent presurgical assessment for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The scalp signals were time-locked to the peak activity in the FO electrode recordings and source modeling was performed using the RELAVG technique. Random noise of various amounts was then applied. The results were compared to intracranial data obtained from the FO electrode recordings and to LORETA source solutions obtained using two other approaches to improve signal to noise ratio (SNR): statistical non-parametric mapping (SNPM) and the commonly applied averaging (AVG) technique. Results: The RELAVG technique allowed for reasonable mesial temporal localization in 52.6% (10/19) of IED patterns, compared with 73.7% (14/19) using SNPM. The AVG technique provided no strictly mesial temporal solutions. Nine of the IED patterns revealed relative current density quotient changes &gt;10; all of these were accurately localized by RELAVG into mesial temporal structures. Increasing amounts of white and physiological noise had no influence on the accuracy of RELAVG and SNPM solutions, whereas AVG source reconstructions became progressively spurious. Conclusion: The RELAVG technique and SNPM, but not the commonly used AVG technique, allow for reasonable source localization of mesial temporal IED. SNPM is the most accurate but also the most time-consuming noise reduction technique. Significance: The RELAVG LORETA technique might provide a simple and fast semi-quantitative alternative for localizing IED with low single to noise ratio. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Objective: We have investigated intracerebral propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) by using spatiotemporal source maps based on statistical nonparametric mapping (SNPM) of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) values. Methods: We analyzed 30 patterns of IED recorded simultaneously with scalp and intracranial foramen ovale (FO) electrodes in 15 consecutive patients with intractable MTLE. The scalp EEG signals were averaged time-locked to the peak activity in bilateral 10-contact FO electrode recordings. SNPM was applied to LORETA values and spatiotemporal source maps were created by allocating the t-values over time to their corresponding Brodmann areas. Propagation was defined as secondary statistically significant involvement of distinct cortical areas separated by &gt;15 ms. The results were correlated with intracranial data obtained from FO electrode recordings and with scalp EEG recordings. All patients underwent subsequent amygdalo-hippocampectomy and outcome was assessed one year after surgery. Results: We found mesial to lateral propagation in 6/30 IED patterns (20%, four patients), lateral to mesial propagation in 4/30 IED patterns (13.3%, four patients) and simultaneous (within 15 ms) activation of mesial and lateral temporal areas in 6/30 IED patterns (20%, five patients). Propagation generally occurred within 30 ms and was always limited to ipsilateral cortical regions. Nine/30 IED patterns (30%) showed restricted activation of mesial temporal structures and no significant solutions were found in 5/30 IED patterns (16.7%). There was no clear association between the number or characteristics of IED patterns and the postsurgical outcome. Conclusions: Spatiotemporal mapping of SNPM LORETA accurately describes mesial to lateral temporal propagation of IED, and vice versa, which commonly occur in patients with MTLE. Significance: Intracerebral propagation must be considered when using non-invasive source algorithms in patients with MTLE. Spatiotemporal mapping might be useful for visualizing this propagation. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.<p>

<li>Zumsteg D, Andrade DM, Wennberg RA: Source localization of small sharp spikes: Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (loreta) reveals two distinct cortical sources. Clinical Neurophysiology 2006;117:1380-1387.<p>
Summary: Objective: We have investigated the cortical sources and electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics of small sharp spikes (SSS) by using statistical non-parametric mapping (SNPM) of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Methods: We analyzed 7 SSS patterns (501 individual SSS) in 6 patients who underwent sleep EEG studies with 29 or 23 scalp electrodes. The scalp signals were averaged time-locked to the SSS peak activity and subjected to SNPM of LORETA values. Results: All 7 SSS patterns (mean 72 individual SSS, range 11-200) revealed a very similar and highly characteristic transhemispheric oblique scalp voltage distribution comprising a first negative field maximum over ipsilateral lateral temporal areas, followed by a second negative field maximum over the contralateral subtemporal region approximately 30 ms later. SNPM-LORETA consistently localized the first component into the ipsilateral posterior insular region, and the second component into ipsilateral posterior mesial temporo-occipital structures. Conclusions: SSS comprise an amalgam of two sequential, distinct cortical components, showing a very uniform and peculiar EEG pattern and cortical source solutions. As such, they must be clearly distinguished from interictal epileptiform discharges in patients with epilepsy. Significance: The awareness of these peculiar EEG characteristics may increase our ability to differentiate SSS from interictal epileptiform activity. The finding of a posterior insular source might serve as an inspiration for new physiological considerations regarding these enigmatic waveforms. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.<p>

Summary: Objective: Subclinical rhythmic electrographic discharges of adults (SREDA) is currently considered a benign EEG pattern of uncertain significance. The underlying cortical sources and generating mechanisms are unknown. We performed a source localization analysis of SREDA with the aim of better understanding this unusual EEG pattern. Methods: Multiple spontaneous episodes of typical SREDA were recorded in a patient during continuous EEG monitoring. Additional SREDA episodes were induced by hyperventilation. Source localization was carried out using statistical non-parametric mapping (SNPM) of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: SNPM of both time- and frequency-domain LORETA revealed a widespread biparietal cortical origin of SREDA, the anatomical distribution of which included the parietal operculum and the known vascular watershed areas between anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Vigorous deep hyperventilation induced SREDA on three of four attempts. Mean duration of the hyperventilation-induced SREDA was approximately three times longer than spontaneous events. Conclusions: Investigations in this patient with typical SREDA revealed hyperventilation sensitivity and a posterior hemispheric source localization maximal in the parietal cortex bilaterally, in large part overlying the anatomical distribution of the vascular watershed areas. Significance: The source localization results and sensitivity to hyperventilation suggest some sort of association between cerebral vascular supply and SREDA, as originally proposed by Naquet et al.

Summary: In the present study, we have validated the cortical potential imaging (CPI) technique for estimating cortical potentials from scalp EEG using simultaneously recorded electrocorticogram (ECoG) in the presence of strong local inhomogeneity, i.e., Silastic ECoG grid(s). The finite element method (FEM) was used to model the realistic postoperative head volume conductor, which includes the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain, as well as the Silastic ECoG grid(s) implanted during the surgical evaluation in epilepsy patients, from the co-registered magnetic resonance (MR) and computer tomography (CT) images. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the present FEM-based CPI technique and to assess the effect of the Silastic ECoG grid on the scalp EEG forward solutions. The present simulation results show that the Silastic ECoG grid has substantial influence on the scalp potential forward solution due to the distortion of current pathways in the presence of the extremely low conductive materials. On the other hand, its influence on the estimated cortical potential distribution is much less than that on the scalp potential distribution. With appropriate numerical modeling and inverse estimation techniques, we have demonstrated the feasibility of estimating the cortical potentials from the scalp EEG with the implanted Silastic ECoG gird(s), in both computer simulations and in human experimentation. In an epilepsy patient undergoing surgical evaluation, the cortical potentials were reconstructed from the simultaneously recorded scalp EEG, in which main features of spatial patterns during interictal spike were preserved and over 0.75 correlation coefficient value was obtained between the recorded and estimated cortical potentials. The FEM-based CPI technique provides a means of connecting the simultaneous recorded ECoG and the scalp EEG and promises to become an effective tool to evaluate and validate CPI techniques using clinic data. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Objective: To report on presence of human EEG spindle oscillations on the cortical level within flat periods of the burst-suppression pattern during propofol-induced anesthesia; to search for corresponding oscillations and possible functional connections. Methods: Artefact-free epochs of spindle activation were selected from the electroencephalograms of opiate-dependent patients undergoing rapid opiate detoxification. Power spectral analysis and source localization using low-resolution-brain-electromagnetic-tomography (LORETAKey) were performed. Results: Sinusoidal rhythms with waxing and waning amplitudes appeared after propofol-induced narcosis but no direct correlations could be determined between individual dosage and characteristic spindle attributes. The power maximum stood midline over the cortical areas, especially around Cz. We calculated a peak frequency of 14(±1.2) Hz. Motor fields, particularly in the frontal, parietal, and various cingulate areas, were found to be the primary sources of spindle oscillations in the cortex. Conclusions: The frequent occurrence of these localized spindle sources demonstrates the preference for motor fields. Spindle oscillations observed during propofol-induced narcosis were similar in frequency and shape to those observed in natural sleep. Significance: The results lend support to models that postulate a close link between the motor system and the organization of behavior. In addition, spindle rhythms under propofol bore some resemblance to spindle types which occur during sleep. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Waldorp LJ, Huizenga HM, Grasman RPPP, Bo?cker KBE, Molenaar PCM: Hypothesis testing in distributed source models for eeg and meg data. Human Brain Mapping 2006;27:114-128.<p>
Summary: Hypothesis testing in distributed source models for the electro- or magnetoencephalogram is generally performed for each voxel separately. Derived from the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, such a statistical parametric map (SPM) ignores the spatial smoothing in hypothesis testing with distributed source models. For example, when intending to test a single voxel, actually an entire region of voxels is tested simultaneously. Because there are more parameters than observations, typically constraints are employed to arrive at a solution which spatially smooths the solution. If ignored, it can be concluded from the hypothesis test that there is activity at some location where there is none. In addition, an SPM on distributed source models gives the illusion of very high resolution. As an alternative, a multivariate approach is suggested in which a region of interest is tested that is spatially smooth. In simulations with MEG and EEG it is shown that clear hypothesis testing in distributed source models is possible, provided that there is high correspondence between what is intended to be tested and what is actually tested. The approach is also illustrated by an application to data from an experiment measuring visual evoked fields when presenting checker-board patterns. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: This study examined auditory processing in 2-month-old infants at genetic risk for dyslexia and in controls. Manipulated natural speech stimuli (/bAk/ and /dAk/), at either side of the phoneme boundary, were presented to these infants and their automatic cortical deviance responses were recorded. Control infants showed two distinct mismatch responses, thus extending similar findings reported with kindergartners in terms of topographical distribution and cortical sources. The absence of such mismatch responses in the infants at risk supports the hypothesis of basic auditory (temporal) processing impairments in the disorder. The results suggest that these early signs of deficient auditory processing may point to problematic categorical perception at a later age. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

Summary: Event-related potentials (ERPs) induced by visual perception and cognitive tasks have been extensively studied in neuropsychological experiments. ERP activities time-locked to stimulus presentation and task performance are often observed separately at individual scalp channels based on averaged time series across epochs and experimental subjects. An analysis using averaged EEG dynamics could discount information regarding interdependency between ongoing EEG and salient ERP features. Advanced tools such as independent component analysis (ICA) have been developed for decomposing collections of single-trial EEG records into separate features. Those features (or independent components) can then be mapped onto the cortical surface using source localization algorithms to visualize brain activation maps and to study between-subject consistency. In this study, we propose a statistical framework for estimating the time course of spatiotemporally independent EEG components simultaneously with their cortical distributions. Within this framework, we implemented Bayesian spatiotemporal analysis for imaging the sources of EEG features on the cortical surface. The framework allows researchers to include prior knowledge regarding spatial locations as well as spatiotemporal independence of different EEG sources. The use of the Electromagnetic Spatiotemporal ICA (EMSICA) method is illustrated by mapping event-related EEG dynamics induced by events in a visual two-back continuous performance task. The proposed method successfully identified several interesting components with plausible corresponding cortical activation topographies, including processes contributing to the late positive complex (LPC) located in central parietal, frontal midline, and anterior cingulate cortex, to atypical mu rhythms associated with the precentral gyrus, and to the central posterior alpha activity in the precuneus. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Stern J, Jeanmonod D, Sarnthein J: Persistent eeg overactivation in the cortical pain matrix of neurogenic pain patients. NeuroImage 2006;31:721-731.<p>
Summary: Functional brain imaging of pain over the last years has provided insight into a distributed anatomical matrix involved in pain processing which includes multiple cortical areas. EEG/MEG-based imaging studies have mostly relied on settings of evoked nociception. We report here the spontaneous presence of enhanced activations in the pain matrix of the patient group on the basis of continuous EEG and functional Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from 16 chronic neurogenic pain patients and 16 healthy controls. These overactivations occurred predominantly within the high theta (6-9 Hz) and low beta frequency ranges (12-16 Hz). Theta and beta overactivations were localized to multiple pain-associated areas, primarily to insular (IC), anterior cingulate (ACC), prefrontal, and inferior posterior parietal cortices, as well as to primary (S1), secondary (S2), and supplementary somatosensory (SSA) cortices. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT), we followed a subgroup of 6 patients. Twelve months after surgery, activation in cingulate and insular cortices was significantly reduced. The presence of rhythmic processes in multiple, partially overlapping areas of the cortical pain matrix concur with the concept of thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) that predicts increased thalamocortical low and high frequency oscillations ensuing from thalamic desactivation. These spontaneous, ongoing, frequency-specific overactivations may therefore serve as an anatomo-physiological hallmark of the processes underlying chronic neurogenic pain. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Stein M, Dierks T, Brandeis D, Wirth M, Strik W, Koenig T: Plasticity in the adult language system: A longitudinal electrophysiological study on second language learning. NeuroImage 2006;33:774-783.<p>
Summary: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to trace changes in brain activity related to progress in second language learning. Twelve English-speaking exchange students learning German in Switzerland were recruited. ERPs to visually presented single words from the subjects' native language (English), second language (German) and an unknown language (Romansh) were measured before (day 1) and after (day 2) 5 months of intense German language learning. When comparing ERPs to German words from day 1 and day 2, we found topographic differences between 396 and 540 ms. These differences could be interpreted as a latency shift indicating faster processing of German words on day 2. Source analysis indicated that the topographic differences were accounted for by shorter activation of left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) on day 2. In ERPs to English words, we found Global Field Power differences between 472 and 644 ms. This may due to memory traces related to English words being less easily activated on day 2. Alternatively, it might reflect the fact that - with German words becoming familiar on day 2 - English words loose their oddball character and thus produce a weaker P300-like effect on day 2. In ERPs to Romansh words, no differences were observed. Our results reflect plasticity in the neuronal networks underlying second language acquisition. They indicate that with a higher level of second language proficiency, second language word processing is faster and requires shorter frontal activation. Thus, our results suggest that the reduced IFG activation found in previous fMRI studies might not reflect a generally lower activation but rather a shorter duration of activity. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Primary cold and warm afferent fibers show a robust overshoot in their firing during periods of temperature change, which subsides during tonic thermal stimulation. Our objective was to analyze cortical activation, on a scale of hundreds of milliseconds, occurring during the process of dynamic cooling and warming, based on an evaluation of the amplitude changes seen in 10 Hz electroencephalographic oscillations. Eleven right-handed subjects were exposed to innocuous cold ramp stimuli (from 32°C to 22°C, 10°C/s) and warm ramp stimuli (32°C to 42°C, 10°C/s) on the thenar region of their right palm, using a contact thermode. EEG was recorded from 111 scalp sites, and the 10 Hz current source densities were modeled using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. During cooling, the earliest amplitude decreases of 10 Hz oscillations were seen in the contralateral posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and the premotor cortex (PMC). During warming, the earliest events were only observed in the PMC and occurred ? 0.7 s later than during cooling. Linear regression analysis between 10 Hz current source densities and temperature variations revealed cooling-sensitive activation in the bilateral posterior insula, PMC and the anterior cingulate cortex. During warming, the amplitude of 10 Hz oscillations in the PMC and posterior insula correlated with stimulus temperature. Dynamic thermal stimulation activates, in addition to the posterior insula and parietal operculum, the lateral PMC. The activation of the anterior cingulate cortex during cooling may aid in the anticipation of the cold temperature end-point and provide continuous evaluation of the thermal stimulus. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to investigate the processing of cluster and noncluster initial consonants in consonant-vowel syllables in the human brain. The MMN was elicited by either syllable with cluster or noncluster initial consonant, phonetic contrasts being identical in both syllables. Compared to the noncluster consonant, the cluster consonant elicited a more prominent MMN. The MMN to the cluster consonant occurred later than that of the noncluster consonant. The topography of the mismatch responses showed clear left-hemispheric laterality in both syllables. However, the syllable with an initial noncluster consonant stimulus produced MMN maximum over the middle temporal gyrus, whereas maximum of the MMN activated by the syllable with initial cluster consonant was observed over the superior temporal gyrus. We suggest that the MMN component in consonant-vowel syllables is more sensitive to cluster compared to noncluster initial consonants. Spatial and temporal features of the cluster consonant indicate delayed activation of left-lateralized perisylvian cell assemblies that function as cortical memory traces of cluster initial consonant in consonant-vowel syllables.<p>

<li>Se?verac Cauquil A, Trotter Y, Taylor MJ: At what stage of neural processing do perspective depth cues make a difference? Experimental Brain Research 2006;170:457-463.<p>
Summary: The present study investigated the cortical processing of three-dimensional (3D) perspective cues in humans, to determine how the brain computes depth from a bidimensional retinal image. We recorded visual evoked potentials in 12 subjects in response to flat and in-perspective stimuli, which evoked biphasic potentials over posterior electrodes. The first, positive component (P1, at 90 ms) was not sensitive to perspective, while the second, negative peak (N1 at ?150 ms) was significantly larger for 3D stimuli, regardless of attention. The amplitude increase due to perspective was seen on all posterior electrodes, but was largest over the right hemisphere, particularly at parietal sites. Source modeling low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) confirmed that among the different areas participating in two- and three-dimensional stimuli processing, the right parietal source is the most enhanced by perspective depth cues. We conclude that the extraction of depth from perspective cues occurs at a second level of stimulus processing, by increasing the activity of the regions involved in 2D stimuli processing, particularly in the right hemisphere, possibly through feedback loops from higher cortical areas. These modulations would participate in the fine-tuned analysis of the 3D features of stimuli. © Springer-Verlag 2005.<p>

Summary: The present study investigated the relation of brain activity patterns measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and slow event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with a complex cognitive task. A second goal was to examine the neural correlates of spatial imagery of haptically - instead of visually - acquired representations. Using a mental image scanning task, spatial imagery requirements were systematically manipulated by parametrically varying the distance between haptically acquired landmarks. Results showed a close relation between slow ERPs and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in human parietal lobe. Reaction times of mental scanning correlated with the distances between landmarks on the learned display. In parallel, duration and amplitude of slow ERPs and duration of the haemodynamic response systematically varied as a function of mental scanning distance. Source analysis confirmed that the ERP imagery effect likely originated from the same cortical substrate as the corresponding BOLD effect. This covariation of the BOLD signal with slow ERPs is in line with recent findings in animals demonstrating a tight link between local field potentials and the BOLD signal. The parietal location of the imagery effect is consistent with the idea that externally triggered (perceptual) and mentally driven (imagery) spatial processes are both mediated by the same supramodal brain areas. © The Authors (2006).<p>

<li>Saletu B, Anderer P, Saletu-Zyhlarz GM: Eeg topography and tomography (loreta) in the classification and evaluation of the pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs. Clinical EEG and Neuroscience 2006;37:66-80.<p>
Summary: By multi-lead computer-assisted quantitative analyses of human scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (QEEG) in combination with certain statistical procedures (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) and mapping techniques (pharmaco-EEG mapping or topography), it is possible to classify psychotropic substances and objectively evaluate their bioavailability at the target organ, the human brain. Specifically, one may determine at an early stage of drug development whether a drug is effective on the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo, what its clinical efficacy will be like, at which dosage it acts, when it acts and the equipotent dosages of different galenic formulations. Pharmaco-EEG maps of neuroleptics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, psychostimulants and nootropics/cognition-enhancing drugs will be described. Methodological problems, as well as the relationships between acute and chronic drug effects, alterations in normal subjects and patients, CNS effects and therapeutic efficacy will be discussed. Imaging of drug effects on the regional brain electrical activity of healthy subjects by means of EEG tomography such as low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been used for identifying brain areas predominantly involved in psychopharmacological action. This will be shown for the representative drugs of the four main psychopharmacological classes, such as 3 mg haloperidol for neuroleptics, 20 mg citalopram for antidepressants, 2 mg lorazepam for tranquilizers and 20 mg methylphenidate for psychostimulants. LORETA demonstrates that these psychopharmacological classes affect brain structures differently. By considering these differences between psychotropic drugs and placebo in normal subjects, as well as between mental disorder patients and normal controls, it may be possible to choose the optimum drug for a specific patient according to a key-lock principle, since the drug should normalize the deviant brain function. Thus, pharmaco-EEG topography and tomography are valuable methods in human neuropsychopharmacology, clinical psychiatry and neurology.<p>

<li>Rodri?guez V, Valde?s-Sosa M: Sensory suppression during shifts of attention between surfaces in transparent motion. Brain Research 2006;1072:110-118.<p>
Summary: During transparent motion, attention to changes in the direction of one illusory surface will impede recognition of a similar event affecting the other surface if both are close together in time. This is a form of object-based attentional blink (AB). Here, we show that this AB is related to a smaller N200 response to the change in direction and that the response is even smaller for trials on which the subject makes mistakes compared to those with correct responses consistent with signal detection theory models. The variation of N200 associated with the AB can be modeled by an attenuation of current sources estimated in visual extrastriate cortex. These results suggest that the AB in the transparent motion paradigm is due to the suppression of sensory signals in early visual areas. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Riera JJ, Valde?s PA, Tanabe K, Kawashima R: A theoretical formulation of the electrophysiological inverse problem on the sphere. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2006;51:1737-1758.<p>
Summary: The construction of three-dimensional images of the primary current density (PCD) produced by neuronal activity is a problem of great current interest in the neuroimaging community, though being initially formulated in the 1970s. There exist even now enthusiastic debates about the authenticity of most of the inverse solutions proposed in the literature, in which low resolution electrical tomography (LORETA) is a focus of attention. However, in our opinion, the capabilities and limitations of the electro and magneto encephalographic techniques to determine PCD configurations have not been extensively explored from a theoretical framework, even for simple volume conductor models of the head. In this paper, the electrophysiological inverse problem for the spherical head model is cast in terms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) formalism, which allows us to identify the null spaces of the implicated linear integral operators and also to define their representers. The PCD are described in terms of a continuous basis for the RKHS, which explicitly separates the harmonic and non-harmonic components. The RKHS concept permits us to bring LORETA into the scope of the general smoothing splines theory. A particular way of calculating the general smoothing splines is illustrated, avoiding a brute force discretization prematurely. The Bayes information criterion is used to handle dissimilarities in the signal/noise ratios and physical dimensions of the measurement modalities, which could affect the estimation of the amount of smoothness required for that class of inverse solution to be well specified. In order to validate the proposed method, we have estimated the 3D spherical smoothing splines from two data sets: electric potentials obtained from a skull phantom and magnetic fields recorded from subjects performing an experiment of human faces recognition. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.<p>

Summary: This paper describes the work being conducted in the domain of brain-computer interaction (BCI) at the Multimodal Interaction Group, Computer Vision and Multimedia Laboratory, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. The application focus of this work is on multimodal interaction rather than on rehabilitation, that is how to augment classical interaction by means of physiological measurements. Three main research topics are addressed. The first one concerns the more general problem of brain source activity recognition from EEGs. In contrast with classical deterministic approaches, we studied iterative robust stochastic based reconstruction procedures modeling source and noise statistics, to overcome known limitations of current techniques. We also developed procedures for optimal electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor system design in terms of placement and number of electrodes. The second topic is the study of BCI protocols and performance from an information-theoretic point of view. Various information rate measurements have been compared for assessing BCI abilities. The third research topic concerns the use of EEG and other physiological signals for assessing a user's emotional status. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: People often remain &quot;blind&quot; to visual changes occurring during a brief interruption of the display. The processing stages responsible for such failure remain unresolved. We used event-related potentials to determine the time course of brain activity during conscious change detection versus change blindness. Participants saw two successive visual displays, each with two faces, and reported whether one of the faces changed between the first and second displays. Relative to blindness, change detection was associated with a distinct pattern of neural activity at several successive processing stages, including an enhanced occipital P1 response and a sustained frontal activity (CNV-like potential) after the first display, before the change itself. The amplitude of the N170 and P3 responses after the second visual display were also modulated by awareness of the face change. Furthermore, a unique topography of event-related potential activity was observed during correct change and correct nochange reports, but not during blindness, with a recurrent time course in the stimulus sequence and simultaneous sources in the parietal and temporo-occipital cortex. These results indicate that awareness of visual changes may depend on the attentional state subserved by coordinated neural activity in a distributed network, before the onset of the change itself. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<p>

Summary: Event related potentials (ERP) are important clinical and research instruments in neuropsychiatry, particularly due to their strategic role for the investigation of brain function. These techniques are often underutilized in the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, but nevertheless they can be most useful and highly effective in the diagnostic workup of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in monitoring the course of the disorders and the prediction of treatment responses. ERP are noninvasive instruments that directly reflect cortical neuronal activity. Cortical neuronal dysfunction plays a major role in variable neuropsychiatric disorders, and a change in cortical activity under medication might reflect treatment response and could be useful for monitoring drug effects. ERP are the only methods with a sufficiently high time resolution for the analysis of the dynamic patterns of neuronal brain activity, e.g., synchronization and desynchronization, oscillations, coherence, gamma band activity, latency of event related activity, etc., which are crucial for a deeper understanding of functional (neurophysiological) correlates of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances in neuropsychiatric patients. Methodological advances have further improved and strengthened the position of ERP concerning research and clinical application. The usefulness and applicability of ERP in determining and monitoring clinico-pharmacological effects will be summarized mainly by focussing on the auditory evoked P300 and the N1/P2 component of auditory evoked potentials. Owing to important recent developments in the field of brain functional diagnostics the combination of neurophysiological techniques and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be included.<p>

Summary: Depression has been associated with dysfunctional executive functions and abnormal activity within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region critically involved in action regulation. Prior research invites the possibility that executive deficits in depression may arise from abnormal responses to negative feedback or errors, but the underlying neural substrates remain unknown. We hypothesized that abnormal reactions to error would be associated with dysfunctional rostral ACC activity, a region previously implicated in error detection and evaluation of the emotional significance of events. To test this hypothesis, subjects with low and high Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores performed an Eriksen Flanker task. To assess whether tonic activity within the rostral ACC predicted post-error adjustments, 128-channel resting EEG data were collected before the task and analyzed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) using a region-of-interest approach. High BDI subjects were uniquely characterized by significantly lower accuracy after incorrect than correct trials. Mirroring the behavioral findings, high BDI subjects had significantly reduced pretask gamma (36.5-44 Hz) current density within the affective (rostral; BA24, BA25, BA32) but not cognitive (dorsal; BA24?, BA32?) ACC subdivision. For low, but not high, BDI subjects pretask gamma within the affective ACC subdivision predicted post-error adjustments even after controlling for activity within the cognitive ACC subdivision. Abnormal responses to errors may thus arise due to lower activity within regions subserving affective and/or motivational responses to salient cues. Because rostral ACC regions have been implicated in treatment response in depression, our findings provide initial insight into putative mechanisms fostering treatment response. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization model that aims at finding localized, part-based, representations of nonnegative multivariate data items. Unlike the classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, this new model, denoted &quot;nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization&quot; (nsNMF), corresponds to the optimization of an unambiguous cost function designed to explicitly represent sparseness, in the form of nonsmoothness, which is controlled by a single parameter. In general, this method produces a set of basis and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the original data, but they also extract highly localized patterns, which generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: The present study investigated the cortical regions activated during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep by identifying the sources of electric currents of brain potentials related to rapid eye movements using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The brain potentials measured were the lambda response (P1 and P2) during wakefulness and the lambda-like response (P1r and P2r) during REM sleep. Fifteen healthy university students participated in this study. During wakefulness, the sources of the electric current of the lambda response (P1 and P2) were estimated to be in the primary and secondary visual cortices (BA 17, 18). During REM sleep, the P1r has a source in a higher order visual area (precuneus; BA 7, 31) and P2r comes from the primary and secondary visual cortices (BA 17, 18). In addition, the density of electric current in the premotor and fronto-central regions including anterior cingulate gyrus was higher after rapid eye movements, which was a discriminative feature of REM sleep. The results of this study suggest that these activities that occur after rapid eye movements might underlie the generation of vivid visual images of dreaming. © 2006 The Author Journal compilation © 2006 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.<p>

Summary: Objective: Chronic smoking and nicotine exposure are accompanied by impaired cognitive task performance, modulated cerebral activity in brain imaging studies, and neuritic damage in experimental animals. The profile of the described dysfunctions matches frontal lobe circuits which also play a role in reward processing and reinforcement behavior. However, it is largely unknown if cerebral dysfunctions are reversible or persist during long term abstinence. Materials and methods: Cortical activation during auditory target processing (oddball task, P300 component) was recorded with 32-channel EEG in 247 healthy subjects consisting of 84 smokers, 53 former smokers (mean time of abstinence 11.9 years), and 110 never smokers. Results: Both current smokers and former smokers exhibited significantly diminished P300 amplitudes (Cz, Pz) relative to never smokers. Neuroelectric source analysis (low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) revealed a hypoactivation of the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, and prefrontal cortex in smokers compared to never smokers. A similar profile of hypoactivation was observed in former smokers. Conclusion: For the first time, evidence is provided that dysfunctional activation of frontal lobe networks in smokers is also present in long term abstainers. © Springer-Verlag 2006.<p>

Summary: An important reason for the interest in P300 event-related potentials are findings in patients with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or alcoholism in which attenuations of the P300 amplitude are common findings. The P300 wave has been suggested to be a promising endophenotype for genetic research since attenuations of the amplitude and latency can be observed not only in patients but also in relatives. In parallel, the search for genes involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders has revealed for both, schizophrenia and alcoholism an association with a DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism in a number of studies. In the present study, we have investigated 124 unrelated healthy subjects of German descent and have found diminished parietal and increased frontal P300 amplitudes in Gly9 homozygotes in comparison to Ser9 carriers. This finding suggests a possible role of the DRD3 receptor gene in the interindividual variation of P300 amplitudes. Further studies should address the direct role of the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism in attenuated P300 amplitudes in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or alcoholism. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Meyer M, Baumann S, Jancke L: Electrical brain imaging reveals spatio-temporal dynamics of timbre perception in humans. NeuroImage 2006;32:1510-1523.<p>
Summary: Timbre is a major attribute of sound perception and a key feature for the identification of sound quality. Here, we present event-related brain potentials (ERPs) obtained from sixteen healthy individuals while they discriminated complex instrumental tones (piano, trumpet, and violin) or simple sine wave tones that lack the principal features of timbre. Data analysis yielded enhanced N1 and P2 responses to instrumental tones relative to sine wave tones. Furthermore, we applied an electrical brain imaging approach using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to estimate the neural sources of N1/P2 responses. Separate significance tests of instrumental vs. sine wave tones for N1 and P2 revealed distinct regions as principally governing timbre perception. In an initial stage (N1), timbre perception recruits left and right (peri-)auditory fields with an activity maximum over the right posterior Sylvian fissure (SF) and the posterior cingulate (PCC) territory. In the subsequent stage (P2), we uncovered enhanced activity in the vicinity of the entire cingulate gyrus. The involvement of extra-auditory areas in timbre perception may imply the presence of a highly associative processing level which might be generally related to musical sensations and integrates widespread medial areas of the human cortex. In summary, our results demonstrate spatio-temporally distinct stages in timbre perception which not only involve bilateral parts of the peri-auditory cortex but also medially situated regions of the human brain associated with emotional and auditory imagery functions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: The authors studied the relationship between performance on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) and P300 activity in schizophrenics and normal controls. Fourteen male predominantly medicated schizophrenics and matched non-ill controls were administered the WCST and tests of temporal lobe (delayed verbal and spatial memory) and general intellectual functioning (Shipley). Patients were rated with negative and positive symptom scales extracted from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Subjects performed a tone discrimination task requiring identification of rare targets in both a standard oddball paradigm and a three-stimulus paradigm that included rare novel sounds. Reference independent data from 16 scalp electrodes yielded Global Field Power (GFP), from which P300 latency was determined. P300 amplitude measures included amplitude at this identified latency as well as amplitude integrated over a 100 ms time window centered over it. These amplitude measures were examined at six selected electrode locations. Schizophrenics produced smaller P300 responses that tended to be slower, but there were no group differences in the relationships between neuropsychological performance and P300 responses. Across diagnostic groups percent perseverative errors predicted lower integrated and peak P300 amplitude during the novel but not the standard oddball paradigm. The effect on integrated P300 amplitude was localized to anterior leads after novel stimuli. Negative symptoms predicted lower WCST performance, lower integrated P300 amplitude, and smaller GFP after novel stimuli. Positive symptoms predicted reduced overall GFP and specific but inconsistent reductions in parietal P300 amplitude. The results suggest relationships between dorsolateral prefrontal competence, P300 activity in response to stimulus novelty, and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients, paralleling findings obtained from blood flow and other measures of brain activity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<li>Lorig TS, Rigdon M, Poor A: Temporal pattern of odor administration alters hemispheric processing in humans. NeuroReport 2006;17:231-234.<p>
Summary: Evidence from a variety of sensory modalities has suggested that the left hemisphere may be 'tuned' to process more rapidly changing stimuli than the right and some have suggested that this difference forms the foundation of the functional dichotomy often drawn between the two hemispheres. Odors may be thought to engage these same temporally dependent processes as portions of an odor mixture may come to be transduced into a phasic series of neural events. Using brain electrical activity, we show that the temporal sequence of the odor alters the pattern of brain electrical activity. Estimates of the source localization for this activity indicate that rapidly changing odors, like sounds, visual and tactile stimuli, show increased activity in the left hemisphere. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

<li>Liu H, Schimpf PH: Efficient localization of synchronous eeg source activities using a modified rap-music algorithm. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2006;53:652-661.<p>
Summary: Synchronization across different brain regions is suggested to be a possible mechanism for functional integration. Noninvasive analysis of the synchronization among cortical areas is possible if the electrical sources can be estimated by solving the electroencephalography inverse problem. Among various inverse algorithms, spatio-temporal dipole fitting methods such as RAP-MUSIC and R-MUSIC have demonstrated superior ability in the localization of a restricted number of independent sources, and also have the ability to reliably reproduce temporal waveforms. However, these algorithms experience difficulty in reconstructing multiple correlated sources. Accurate reconstruction of correlated brain activities is critical in synchronization analysis. In this study, we modified the well-known inverse algorithm RAP-MUSIC to a multistage process which analyzes the correlation of candidate sources and searches for independent topographies (ITs) among precorrelated groups. Comparative studies were carried out on both simulated data and clinical seizure data. The results demonstrated superior performance with the modified algorithm compared to the original RAP-MUSIC in recovering synchronous sources and localizing the epileptiform activity. The modified RAP-MUSIC algorithm, thus, has potential in neurological applications involving significant synchronous brain activities. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: The electroencephalogram (EEG) has become a widely used tool for investigating brain function. Brain signal source localization is a process of inverse calculation from sensor information (electric potentials for EEG) to the identification of multiple brain sources to obtain the locations and orientation parameters. In this paper, we describe a combination of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) with the nonlinear least-square (NLS) method to localize two dipoles with reasonable accuracy and speed from EEG data computerized by two dipoles randomly positioned in the brain. The trained BPNN, obtains the initial values for the two dipoles through fast calculation and also avoids the influence of noise. Then the NLS method (Powell algorithm) is used to accurately estimate the two dipole parameters. In this study, we also obtain the minimum distance between the assumed dipole pair, 0.8 cm, in order to localize two sources from a smaller limited distance between the dipole pair. The present simulation results demonstrate that the combined method can allow us to localize two dipoles with high speed and accuracy, that is, in 20 seconds and with the position error of around 6.5, and to reduce the influence of noise.

Summary: Brain electric mechanisms of temporary, functional binding between brain regions are studied using computation of scalp EEG coherence and phase locking, sensitive to time differences of few milliseconds. However, such results if computed from scalp data are ambiguous since electric sources are spatially oriented. Non-ambiguous results can be obtained using calculated time series of strength of intracerebral model sources. This is illustrated applying LORETA modeling to EEG during resting and meditation. During meditation, time series of LORETA model sources revealed a tendency to decreased left-right intracerebral coherence in the delta band, and to increased anterior-posterior intracerebral coherence in the theta band. An alternate conceptualization of functional binding is based on the observation that brain electric activity is discontinuous, i.e., that it occurs in chunks of up to about 100 ms duration that are detectable as quasi-stable scalp field configurations of brain electric activity, called microstates. Their functional significance is illustrated in spontaneous and event-related paradigms, where microstates associated with imagery- versus abstract-type mentation, or while reading positive versus negative emotion words showed clearly different regions of cortical activation in LORETA tomography. These data support the concept that complete brain functions of higher order such as a momentary thought might be incorporated in temporal chunks of processing in the range of tens to about 100 ms as quasi-stable brain states; during these time windows, subprocesses would be accepted as members of the ongoing chunk of processing. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Summary: Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated gamma and beta frequency oscillations in response to auditory stimuli. The purpose of this study was to test whether auditory hallucinations (AH) in schizophrenia patients reflect abnormalities in gamma and beta frequency oscillations and to investigate source generators of these abnormalities. This theory was tested using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) source imaging. Twenty-five schizophrenia patients with treatment refractory AH, lasting for at least 2 years, and 23 schizophrenia patients with non-AH (N-AH) in the past 2 years were recruited for the study. Spectral analysis of the qEEG and source imaging of frequency bands of artifact-free 30 s epochs were examined during rest. AH patients showed significantly increased beta 1 and beta 2 frequency amplitude compared with N-AH patients. Gamma and beta (2 and 3) frequencies were significantly correlated in AH but not in N-AH patients. Source imaging revealed significantly increased beta (1 and 2) activity in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left medial frontal gyrus in AH versus N-AH patients. These results imply that AH is reflecting increased beta frequency oscillations with neural generators localized in speech-related areas. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization requires a solution to an ill-posed inverse problem. The additional challenge is to solve this problem in the context of multiple moving sources. An effective and simple technique for both separation and localization of EEG sources is therefore proposed by incorporating an algorithmically coupled blind source separation (BSS) approach. The method relies upon having a priori knowledge of the locations of a subset of the sources. The cost function of the BSS algorithm is constrained by this information, and the unknown sources are iteratively calculated. An important application of this method is to localize abnormal sources, which, for example, cause changes in attention, movement, and behavior. In this application, the Alpha rhythm was considered as the known sources. Simulation studies are presented to support the potential of the approach in terms of source localization. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: In Amblard et al. [Amblard, C., Lapalme, E., Lina, J.M. 2004. Biomagnetic source detection by maximum entropy and graphical models. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 55 (3) 427-442], the authors introduced the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) as a methodological framework for solving the magnetoencephalography (MEG) inverse problem. The main component of the MEM is a reference probability density that enables one to include all kind of prior information on the source intensity distribution to be estimated. This reference law also encompasses the definition of a model. We consider a distributed source model together with a clustering hypothesis that assumes functionally coherent dipoles. The reference probability distribution is defined as a prior parceling of the cortical surface. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for parceling out the cortex into regions that are functionally coherent. Based on the recently developed multivariate source prelocalization (MSP) principle [Mattout, J., Pelegrini-Issac, M., Garnero, L., Benali, H. 2005. Multivariate source prelocalization (MSP): Use of functionally informed basis functions for better conditioning the MEG inverse problem. NeuroImage 26 (2) 356-373], the data-driven clustering (DDC) of the dipoles provides an efficient parceling of the sources as well as an estimate of parameters of the initial reference probability distribution. On MEG simulated data, the DDC is shown to further improve the MEM inverse approach, as evaluated considering two different iterative algorithms and using classical error metrics as well as ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. The MEM solution is also compared to a LORETA-like inverse approach. The data-driven clustering allows to take most advantage of the MEM formalism. Its main trumps lie in the flexible probabilistic way of introducing priors and in the notion of spatial coherent regions of activation. The latter reduces the dimensionality of the problem. In so doing, it narrows down the gap between the two types of inverse methods, the popular dipolar approaches and the distributed ones. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Background: Previous studies have detected EEG, cognitive and motor cortex modulation after cerebellar repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The aim of our study was to determine a) if these findings actually reflect cerebellar rTMS or rather neck muscle magnetic stimulation (MMS), and b) if cerebellar rTMS modulates frontal cortex activity. Methods: EEG recordings were obtained from 6 right-handed healthy volunteers before and after 1) rTMS applied over the right cerebellar hemisphere and 2) MMS applied over the right muscle trapezius. We used 20 minutes of 10 Hz rTMS and MMS with 1200 impulses. The spatial distribution of the rTMS and MMS-induced changes in the electrical brain activity were assessed using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results: Right cerebellar rTMS increased the power density in the delta, theta, alpha-1 and beta-2 frequency bands. Power increments in the delta, theta and beta-2 bands were found predominantly over the frontal and parietal lobes, whereas the alpha-1 power was increased bilaterally in the medial cingulate. No significant changes were detected after MMS applied over the trapezius muscle. Conclusions: Our results suggest the feasibility to modulate frontal cortical activity by means of cerebellar rTMS. This could support the use of the cerebellar rTMS in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders where cortico-subcortico-cerebellar abnormalities have been detected.<p>

Summary: Recent studies suggest that human theta oscillations appear to be functionally associated with memory processes. It is less clear, however, to what type of memory sub-processes theta is related. Using a continuous word recognition task with different repetition lags, we investigate whether theta reflects the strength of an episodic memory trace or general processing demands, such as task difficulty. The results favor the episodic trace decay hypothesis and show that during the access of an episodic trace in a time window of ?200-400 ms, theta power decreases with increasing lag (between the first and second presentation of an item). LORETA source localization of this early theta lag effect indicates that parietal regions are involved in episodic trace processing, whereas right frontal regions may guide the process of retrieval. We conclude that episodic encoding can be characterized by two different stages: traces are first processed at parietal sites at ?300 ms, then further processing takes place in regions of the medial temporal lobe at ?500 ms. Only the first stage is related to theta, whereas the second is reflected by a slow wave with a frequency of ?2.5 Hz. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

Summary: We investigated the brain substrate of word repetition effects on the implicit memory task using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) with high-density 128-channel EEG and individual MRI as a realistic head model. Thirteen right-handed, healthy subjects performed a word/non-word discrimination task, in which the words and non-words were presented visually, and some of the words appeared twice with a lag of one or five items. All of the subjects exhibited word repetition effects with respect to the behavioral data, in which a faster reaction time was observed to the repeated word (old word) than to the first presentation of the word (new word). The old words elicited more positive-going potentials than the new words, beginning at 200 ms and lasting until 500 ms post-stimulus. We conducted source reconstruction using LORETA at a latency of 400 ms with the peak mean global field potentials and used statistical parametric mapping for the statistical analysis. We found that the source elicited by the old words exhibited a statistically significant current density reduction in the left inferior frontal gyrus. This is the first study to investigate the generators of word repetition effects using voxel-by-voxel statistical mapping of the current density with individual MRI and high-density EEG. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Objective: To evaluate the comparability of high- and low-density surface Laplacian estimates for determining ERP generator patterns of group data derived from a typical ERP sample size and paradigm. Methods: High-density ERP data (129 sites) recorded from 17 adults during tonal and phonetic oddball tasks were converted to a 10-20-system EEG montage (31 sites) using spherical spline interpolations. Current source density (CSD) waveforms were computed from the high- and low-density, but otherwise identical, ERPs, and correlated at corresponding locations. CSD data were submitted to separate covariance-based, unrestricted temporal PCAs (Varimax of covariance loadings) to identify and effectively summarize temporally and spatially overlapping CSD components. Solutions were compared by correlating factor loadings and scores, and by plotting ANOVA F statistics derived from corresponding high- and low-resolution factor scores using representative sites. Results: High- and low-density CSD waveforms, PCA solutions, and F statistics were remarkably similar, yielding correlations of .9?r?.999 between waveforms, loadings, and scores for almost all comparisons at low-density locations except for low-signal CSD waveforms at occipital sites. Each of the first 10 high-density factors corresponded precisely to one factor of the first 10 low-density factors, with each 10-factor set accounting for the meaningful CSD variance (&gt;91.6%). Conclusions: Low-density surface Laplacian estimates were shown to be accurate approximations of high-density CSDs at these locations, which adequately and quite sufficiently summarized group data. Moreover, reasonable approximations of many high-density scalp locations were obtained for group data from interpolations of low-density data. If group findings are the primary objective, as typical for cognitive ERP research, low-resolution CSD topographies may be as efficient, given the effective spatial smoothing when averaging across subjects and/or conditions. Significance: Conservative recommendations for restricting surface Laplacians to high-density recordings may not be appropriate for all ERP research applications, and should be re-evaluated considering objective, costs and benefits. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Korean Journal of Urology 2006;47:779-785.<p>
Summary: Purpose: Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) is a kind of functional imaging technique and it is also an up-to-date technique for conducting electroencephalography (EEC) analysis. We tried to investigate the locations on the cerebral cortex that are activated by visually stimulated sexual arousal. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three male volunteers (age range: 24.7±1.7 years) among all the right-handed medical students at our university were enrolled in this study. The EEGs included the segments recorded during resting, watching a music-video, intermission and watching a porno-video. The LORETA images of the cross-spectral analysis were obtained with using segments of LORETA-KEY (KEY Institute for Brain-Mind Research, Switzerland) software. Results: In the statistical nonparametric maps (SnPM) of each spectrum and the delta, theta and alpha waves did not show the increased current density. The beta 1, 2 and 3 activity showed the point of maximal current densities in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus of the left limbic lobe and the superior temporal gyrus of both temporal lobes, the superior temporal gyrus of the right temporal lobe, the precuneus of the right parietal lobe, the medial frontal gyrus of the left frontal lobe, the middle occipital gyrus of the right occipital lobe, the superior temporal gyrus of both temporal lobes and the superior frontal gyrus of the right frontal lobe. Conclusions: The sexual arousal by visual stimulation may activate the anterior parahippocampal gyrus of the left limbic lobe, the superior temporal gyrus of both temporal lobes, the precuneus of the right parietal lobe, the medial frontal gyrus of the left frontal gyrus, and the middle occipital gyrus of the right occipital lobe.<p>

Summary: It has become apparent that the electrical signals recorded from the scalp of healthy individuals under standardized conditions are predictable, and that patients with a wide variety of brain disorders display activity with unusual features. It also early became apparent that centrally active medications produced striking changes in this activity. The application of computerized signal analysis to EEG recordings collected using standardized procedures has made it possible to obtain quantitative descriptions of brain electrical activity (QEEG) in normal individuals and patients with disorders of brain function or structure, as well as quantitative description of the ways in which centrally active medications alter this activity (Pharmaco-EEG or &quot;PEEG&quot;). With the emergence of three-dimensional EEG source localization techniques, it has recently become possible to visualize the mathematically most probable generators of QEEG abnormalities within the brain as well as the neuroanatomical regions where abnormal activity is most altered by efficacious medication. As QEEG and PEEG have evolved, a vast body of facts has been accumulated, describing changes in the EEG or event-related potentials (ERPs) observed in a variety of brain disorders or after administration of a variety of medications. With some notable exceptions, these studies have tended to be phenomenological rather than analytic. There has not been a systematic attempt to integrate these phenomena in order to build better understanding of how the abnormal behaviors of a particular psychiatric patient might be related to the specific pattern of the deviant electrical activity, nor just how pharmacological reduction of that deviant activity may have resulted in more normal behavior. This article is an endeavor to provide a more specific theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of the homeostatic system underlying the regulation of the QEEG, and the mechanisms revealed by Pharmaco-EEG that aid in correcting these illnesses.<p>

Summary: QEEG and LORETA have been applied successfully to neuropsychiatric conditions for both diagnosis and treatment guidance using EEG neurotherapy. These techniques aid in providing localization of the sources of normal and abnormal EEG. However, there is confusion about which statistics offer the more accurate data for source density localization. The average clinician is not able to assess the differences in the two most popular data processing programs currently on the market. This paper compares a side-by-side evaluation of NeuroGuide? and EureKa? in order to help the reader visualize the differences between these two imaging programs, which have resulted in different maps.

Summary: A common hypothesis about sex differences in language processing attributes these differences to a bilateral contribution of language-related brain areas in females and a left-hemispheric dominated activation in males. However, most imaging studies failed to find such a generalized lateralization effect and reported a left-lateralized activation in both sexes instead. In a previous semantic priming study, we found a sustained (?190-640 ms) bilateral positivity in the ERP waveforms, which was larger for the female group. Word reading and lexical decision were confounded in that study. In the present study we used a delayed response to separate semantic processing from response selection and execution. The modification of the task design, together with a dense sensor array, showed that females developed a bilateral sustaining posterior positivity/frontal negativity during reading/semantic processing. In contrast, males showed an attenuated positivity at left posterior sites and an attenuated negativity at right frontal sites. This sex-specific lateralization effect disappeared during response processing, evoking a bilaterally distributed activation for both sexes (frontal negative and posterior positive), which was larger for the female subjects. We conclude that, at least under specific conditions, language processing evokes a bilateral activation in females and a lateralization effect in males. However, the processing of the response, which is dominated by a 'P300-like' component evoked by this process, evokes a larger activation in both sexes which obscures the sex-specific lateralization effect when semantic processing and response processing are not separated. © The Author 2005.

Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics 2006;73Summary: Using a physiologically based model of brain activity, electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra are calculated for signals derived from general linear combinations of voltages from multiple electrodes, with and without filtering by volume conduction. Two simple methods of combining scalp measurements to estimate unfiltered EEG power spectra are then proposed and their accuracy and robustness are explored, using the model predictions as an illustration. It is found that these methods, including a case that uses just three electrodes, enable improved estimation of the underlying spectrum relative to each of several widely used combinations alone. © 2006 The American Physical Society.<p>

<li>Heine A, Tamm S, Hofmann M, Bo?sel RM, Jacobs AM: Event-related theta activity reflects memory processes in pronoun resolution. NeuroReport 2006;17:1835-1839.<p>
Summary: A recent eye-tracking study reported a reverse effect of a noun's lexical frequency in the context of the resolution of coreferring pronouns. Investigating the neurophysiological basis of this effect, the present electroencephalographic study found differential patterns in theta activation when participants read pronouns referring to nouns of different frequency classes. Evoked theta power after pronoun onset increased with the frequency of the critical noun. This finding suggests differential load on memory resources depending on the nouns' frequency. Elevated attention promoting memory encoding for low-frequency words is assumed to facyilitate the resolution of pronouns. Location of sources of differential theta activity in the parahippocampal region is accounted for by its role in an association network that mediates memory processes. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Inc.<p>

Summary: While several recent imaging studies confirm that motor foot areas can still be activated in complete and chronic paraplegia, it remains unclear whether their functionality is also maintained or declines after years of &quot;non-use&quot;. Force control is one of the most important and best investigated functions within the motor cortex. It has been repeatedly reported that the motor cortex is more active when higher forces have to be applied. We thus addressed the question of preserved cortical functions by comparing motor force control patterns in the event-related potentials of 10 motor complete paraplegic subjects and 10 controls after attempted (paraplegic patients)/executed (healthy controls) ballistic foot movements with three different force levels. In addition to the peak amplitudes reflecting force levels, peak latencies were also investigated to elucidate timing as another functional aspect of motor control. No significant group difference was found for the peak latencies, indicating that the timing of motor cortical activation is preserved. Concerning amplitudes, we found preserved cortical modulation of higher forces but distorted low force modulation, especially early after injury. These findings thus suggest that important aspects of cortical control over paralyzed limbs are maintained despite years of &quot;non-use&quot;. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Hajo?s M: Targeting information-processing deficit in schizophrenia: A novel approach to psychotherapeutic drug discovery. Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 2006;27:391-398.<p>
Summary: Current observations indicate that dysfunction of neuronal circuitry dynamics contributes to the abnormal information processing in the brain in schizophrenia. It is presumed that disrupted auditory gating, abnormal P300-evoked potentials and deficits in mismatch negativity in schizophrenic patients indicate impaired processing of information. Recently, abnormalities in neuronal synchrony and oscillatory activity have been postulated as the mechanisms that underlie the distorted perception and cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. These novel observations might reveal the pathophysiology of the disorder, and indicate potential targets for antipsychotic drug therapy. Neuronal circuitry dynamics, such as network oscillations and sensory-gating processes, are conserved phylogenetically, which provides excellent opportunities for designing translational biomarkers. Whether preclinical, experimental compounds that impact on network oscillations and sensory processing (such as agonists and modulators of ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) elicit the same neurophysiological events in schizophrenic patients and, subsequently, improve perception and cognitive functions will be determined when these drug candidates are available clinically. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Summary: The formation of cortical object representations requires the activation of cell assemblies, correlated by induced oscillatory bursts above 20 Hz (gamma band), which are characterized by trial-by-trial latency fluctuations around a mean of approximately 300 ms after stimulus onset. The present electroencephalogram (EEG) study was intended to uncover to the generators of induced gamma band responses (GBRs) and to analyze phase-synchronization between these sources. A standard object recognition task was used to elicit gamma activity. At the scalp surface (electrode space), we found an augmentation of induced GBRs after the presentation of meaningful (familiar) as opposed to meaningless (unfamiliar) stimuli, which was accompanied by a dense pattern of significant phase-locking values between distant recording sites. Subsequently, intracranial current density distributions compatible with the observed scalp voltage topographies were estimated by means of VARETA (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In source space brain electrical tomographies (BETs) revealed widespread generators of induced GBRs at temporal, parietal, posterior, and frontal areas. Phase-locking analysis was calculated between re-constructed electrode signals based on separate forward solutions of the observed generators, thereby eliminating the possibly confounding influence of activity from areas not under observation. The results support the view that induced GBRs signify synchronous neuronal activity in a broadly distributed network during object recognition. The localization of the generators of event-related potentials (ERPs), evoked gamma activity, and induced alpha activity revealed different sources as compared to the induced GBR and, thus, seem to mirror complementary functions during the present task as compared to induced high-frequency brain dynamics. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Performing an accurate localization of sources of interictal spikes from EEG scalp measurements is of particular interest during the presurgical investigation of epilepsy. The purpose of this paper is to study the ability of six distributed source localization methods to recover extended sources of activated cortex. Due to the frequent lack of a gold standard to evaluate source localization methods, our evaluation was performed in a controlled environment using realistic simulations of EEG interictal spikes, involving several anatomical locations with several spatial extents. Simulated data were corrupted by physiological EEG noise. Simulations involving pairs of sources with the same amplitude were also studied. In addition to standard validation criteria (e.g., geodesic distance or mean square error), we proposed an original criterion dedicated to assess detection accuracy, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Six source localization methods were evaluated: the minimum norm, the minimum norm weighted by multivariate source prelocalization (MSP), cortical LORETA with or without additional minimum norm regularization, and two derivations of the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) approach. Results showed that LORETA-based and MEM-based methods were able to accurately recover sources of different spatial extents, with the exception of sources in temporo-mesial and fronto-mesial regions. Several spurious sources were generated by those methods, however, whereas methods using the MSP always located very accurately the maximum of activity but not its spatial extent. These findings suggest that one should always take into account the results from different localization methods when analyzing real interictal spikes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Emotions modulate pain perception, although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. In this study, we show that intensity reports significantly increased when painful stimuli were concomitant to images showing human pain, whereas pictures with identical emotional values but without somatic content failed to modulate pain. Early somatosensory responses (&lt;200 ms) remained unmodified by emotions. Conversely, late responses showed a significant enhancement associated with increased pain ratings, localized to the right prefrontal, right temporo-occipital junction, and right temporal pole. In contrast to selective attention, which enhances pain ratings by increasing sensory gain, emotions triggered by seeing other people's pain did not alter processing in SI-SII (primary and second somatosensory areas), but may have biased the transfer to, and the representation of pain in short-term memory buffers (prefrontal), as well as the affective assignment to this representation (temporal pole). Memory encoding and recall, rather than sensory processing, appear to be modulated by empathy with others' physical suffering. Copyright © 2006 Society for Neuroscience.<p>

<li>Go?mez CM, Marco-Pallare?s J, Grau C: Location of brain rhythms and their modulation by preparatory attention estimated by current density. Brain Research 2006;1107:151-160.<p>
Summary: To test the hypothesis that there is a functional modulation of conventional EEG bands associated with preparatory attention, putative changes in the spontaneous brain rhythms and their associated cerebral sources were addressed. The goals of the present report were, first, to find the brain areas with maximal rhythmic activity before warning and imperative stimuli in a classic contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm, and, second, to study the modulation of the EEG rhythms of these areas during the preparatory attention interval which precedes the S2 (imperative) stimulus. Trial by trial LORETA analysis found similar brain rhythm generators during both pre-S1 and pre-S2 intervals. Each theta, alpha and beta traditional EEG rhythm originates in several anatomically distinct brain structures. Preparatory attention is associated with a decrease in power in alpha (right and left occipital and temporal areas) and low-beta (left frontal, bilateral occipital and middle frontal areas) EEG bands. In these structures power changes associated with preparatory attention modulated either a dominant or a non-dominant oscillatory band, suggesting that non-dominant rhythms of a cerebral area have some functional relevance. Our results imply distributed regional sources for brain rhythms and support the view that during preparatory attention there is a modulation of the brain sources generating alpha and beta brain rhythms. Moreover, the proposed combined approach makes it possible to explore the definition of a given brain area not only anatomically, but also by the frequency content and the functional reactivity of the electrical rhythms that it generates. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

<li>Fischmeister FPS, Bauer H: Neural correlates of monocular and binocular depth cues based on natural images: A loreta analysis. Vision Research 2006;46:3373-3380.<p>
Summary: Functional imaging studies investigating perception of depth rely solely on one type of depth cue based on non-natural stimulus material. To overcome these limitations and to provide a more realistic and complete set of depth cues natural stereoscopic images were used in this study. Using slow cortical potentials and source localization we aimed to identify the neural correlates of monocular and binocular depth cues. This study confirms and extends functional imaging studies, showing that natural images provide a good, reliable, and more realistic alternative to artificial stimuli, and demonstrates the possibility to separate the processing of different depth cues. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

<li>Ferri R, Rundo F, Bruni O, Terzano MG, Stam CJ: Regional scalp eeg slow-wave synchronization during sleep cyclic alternating pattern a1 subtypes. Neuroscience Letters 2006;404:352-357.<p>
Summary: The levels of EEG synchronization, in the 0.25-2.5 Hz band, during the A1 subtypes of the sleep &quot;cyclic alternating pattern&quot; (CAP) were measured in five healthy subjects by means of the synchronization likelihood (SL) algorithm. SL was measured for seven electrode pairs (F4-F3, C4-C3, P4-P3 for the analysis of interhemispheric SL and F4-C4, C4-P4, F3-C3, and C3-P3, for the analysis of intrahemispheric SL). During the A1 CAP subtypes, SL tended to be highest between pairs of electrodes situated over different hemispheres; in particular, SL obtained from F4-F3 was the highest, followed by that of P4-P3. These results indicate that the transient high level of synchronization in the slow-wave EEG range, during the sleep A1 CAP subtypes, is a phenomenon involving mostly the anterior parts of the brain and is probably based on interhemispheric interactions, possibly mediated by transcallosal connections. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: DTNBP1 (dysbindin) is one of the several putative schizophrenia genes supported by association, neuroanatomical, and cellular studies. These suggest an involvement of DTNBP1 in the prefrontal cortex and cognitive functions mediated by interaction with neurotransmitter systems, in particular glutamate. The influence of DTNBP1 gene variation on prefrontal brain function at the systemic neurophysiological level, though, has not been characterized. The NoGo-anteriorization (NGA) as an event-related potential (ERP) measure elicited during the continuous performance test (CPT) has been established as a valid neurophysiological parameter for prefrontal brain function in healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenias. In the present study, we therefore investigated the influence of eight dysbindin gene variants on the NGA as a marker of prefrontal brain function in 48 healthy individuals. Two DTNBP1 polymorphisms previously linked to schizophrenia (P1765 and P1320) were found associated with changes in the NGA. Post hoc analysis showing an influence of genetic variation at these loci on the Go centroid and frontal amplitudes suggest that this might be due to modification of the execution of motor processes by the prefrontal cortex. This is the first report on a role of DTNBP1 gene variation for prefrontal brain function at a systemic neurophysiological level in healthy humans. Future studies will have to address the relevance of this observation for patients with schizophrenias. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Ding L, Worrell GA, Lagerlund TD, He B: 3d source localization of interictal spikes in epilepsy patients with mri lesions. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2006;51:4047-4062.<p>
Summary: The present study aims to accurately localize epileptogenic regions which are responsible for epileptic activities in epilepsy patients by means of a new subspace source localization approach, i.e. first principle vectors (FINE), using scalp EEG recordings. Computer simulations were first performed to assess source localization accuracy of FINE in the clinical electrode set-up. The source localization results from FINE were compared with the results from a classic subspace source localization approach, i.e. MUSIC, and their differences were tested statistically using the paired t-test. Other factors influencing the source localization accuracy were assessed statistically by ANOVA. The interictal epileptiform spike data from three adult epilepsy patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy and well-defined symptomatic MRI lesions were then studied using both FINE and MUSIC. The comparison between the electrical sources estimated by the subspace source localization approaches and MRI lesions was made through the coregistration between the EEG recordings and MRI scans. The accuracy of estimations made by FINE and MUSIC was also evaluated and compared by R2 statistic, which was used to indicate the goodness-of-fit of the estimated sources to the scalp EEG recordings. The three-concentric-spheres head volume conductor model was built for each patient with three spheres of different radii which takes the individual head size and skull thickness into consideration. The results from computer simulations indicate that the improvement of source spatial resolvability and localization accuracy of FINE as compared with MUSIC is significant when simulated sources are closely spaced, deep, or signal-to-noise ratio is low in a clinical electrode set-up. The interictal electrical generators estimated by FINE and MUSIC are in concordance with the patients' structural abnormality, i.e. MRI lesions, in all three patients. The higher R2 values achieved by FINE than MUSIC indicate that FINE provides a more satisfactory fitting of the scalp potential measurements than MUSIC in all patients. The present results suggest that FINE provides a useful brain source imaging technique, from clinical EEG recordings, for identifying and localizing epileptogenic regions in epilepsy patients with focal partial seizures. The present study may lead to the establishment of a high-resolution source localization technique from scalp-recorded EEGs for aiding presurgical planning in epilepsy patients. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.<p>

<li>Ding L, He B: Spatio-temporal eeg source localization using a three-dimensional subspace fine approach in a realistic geometry inhomogeneous head model. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2006;53:1732-1739.<p>
Summary: The subspace source localization approach, i.e., first principle vectors (FINE), is able to enhance the spatial resolvability and localization accuracy for closely-spaced neural sources from EEG and MEG measurements. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the FINE algorithm in an inhomogeneous realistic geometry head model under a variety of conditions. The source localization abilities of FINE were examined at different cortical regions and at different depths. The present computer simulation results indicate that FINE has enhanced source localization capability, as compared with MUSIC and RAP-MUSIC, when sources are closely spaced, highly noise-contaminated, or inter-correlated. The source localization accuracy of FINE is better, for closely-spaced sources, than MUSIC at various noise levels, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 6 dB to 16 dB, and RAP-MUSIC at relatively low noise levels, i.e., 6 dB to 12 dB. The FINE approach has been further applied to localize brain sources of motor potentials, obtained during the finger tapping tasks in a human subject. The experimental results suggest that the detailed neural activity distribution could be revealed by FINE. The present study suggests that FINE provides enhanced performance in localizing multiple closely spaced, and inter-correlated sources under low SNR, and may become an important alternative to brain source localization from EEG or MEG. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: The nature of spatial representation in human auditory cortex remains elusive. In particular, although humans can discriminate the locations of sounds as close as 1-10 degrees apart, such resolution has not been shown in auditory cortex of humans or animals. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) event related brain potential to measure the neural response to spatial change in humans in narrow 10 degree spatial steps. Twelve participants were tested using a dense array EEG setup while watching a silent movie and ignoring the sounds. The MMN was reliably elicited by infrequent changes of spatial location of sounds in free field. The MMN amplitude was linearly related to the degree of spatial change with a resolution of at least 10 degrees. These electrophysiological responses occurred within a window of 100-200 milliseconds from stimulus onset, and were localized to the posterior superior temporal gyrus. We conclude that azimuthal spatial displacement is rapidly, accurately and automatically represented in auditory sensory memory in humans, at the level of the auditory cortex. © The Authors (2006).<p>

Summary: Characterizing the cortical activity sources of electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography data is a critical issue since it requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem that does not admit a unique solution. Two main different and complementary source models have emerged: equivalent current dipoles (ECD) and distributed linear (DL) models. While ECD models remain highly popular since they provide an easy way to interpret the solutions, DL models (also referred to as imaging techniques) are known to be more realistic and flexible. In this paper, we show how those two representations of the brain electromagnetic activity can be cast into a common general framework yielding an optimal description and estimation of the EEG sources. From this extended source mixing modelw we derive a hybrid approach whose key aspect is the separation between temporal and spatial characteristics of brain activity, which allows to dramatically reduce the number of DL model parameters. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the sources, as a temporal invariant map, is estimated using the entire time window data, allowing to significantly enhance the information available about the spatial aspect of the EEG inverse problem. A Bayesian framework is introduced to incorporate distinct temporal and spatial constraints on the solution and to estimate both parameters and hyperparameters of the model. Using simulated EEG data, the proposed inverse approach is evaluated and compared with standard distributed methods using both classical criteria and ROC curves. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Age-related change of event-related potentials to novel visual stimuli was investigated while participants attended to both auditory and visual stimulation. Meaningful but irrelevant pictures (novel stimuli) were presented to younger (mean = 21.8, range = 18-26 years) and older (mean = 70.0, range = 60-78) participants (10 in each group). The participants were performing an auditory oddball task and counting silently the changes of a visually presented letter. In the younger group novel stimuli elicited a posterior positivity in the 220-255 ms range. This component habituated to the repetition of the same picture. In the older group this component had longer latency, and did not habituate. A later positivity had shorter latency and larger amplitude in the younger group, but this positivity was preceded by a negative component (N2b) only in the elderly. Results show decreased sensitivity to the content of the visual stimuli in an earlier stage of novelty processing in the elderly, and the age-related slowing of both orientation-related and task-related processes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Event-related potentials were recorded from 30 subjects using sustained stimulation and an indirect task, two strategies which facilitate affective responses that are complete and free of cognitive interference. Stimuli were of three types: pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. A three-phase pattern was found. The first phase, an amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli higher than to neutral and pleasant stimuli, was produced at 160 ms after stimulus onset, the prefrontal cortex being the origin of this phase. The second phase, characterized by maximal amplitudes in response to positive stimuli, was produced at 400 ms, originating in the visual cortex. Finally, the third phase, another amplitude increase in response to negative stimuli, was produced at 680 ms, and its source was located in the left precentral gyrus. Present data show that the cortical response to sustained emotional visual stimulation presented within indirect tasks provides information on attention-, motivation- and motor-related biases that complement information obtained under other experimental conditions. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.<p>

Summary: We develop three parametric models for electroencephalography (EEG) to estimate current sources that are spatially distributed on a line. We assume a realistic head model and solve the EEG forward problem using the boundary element method (BEM). We present the models with increasing degrees of freedom, provide the forward solutions, and derive the maximum-likelihood estimates as well as Crame?r-Rao bounds of the unknown source parameters. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models. We use numerical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our line-source models in estimating extended sources. We also apply our models to the real EEG data of N20 response that is known to have an extended source. We observe that the line-source models explain the N20 measurements better than the dipole model. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for studying the brain functions and is becoming popular in clinical practice. In this paper, we develop four parametric EEG models to estimate current sources that are spatially distributed on a surface. Our models approximate the source shape and extent explicitly and can be applied to localize extended sources which are often encountered, e.g., in epilepsy diagnosis. We assume a realistic head model and solve the EEG forward problem using the boundary element method. We present the source models with increasing degrees of freedom, provide the forward solutions, and derive the maximum-likelihood estimates as well as Crame?r-Rao bounds of the unknown source parameters. In order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models, we first compare their estimation performances with the dipole model's using several known source distributions. We then discuss the conditions under which we can distinguish between the proposed extended sources and the focal dipole using the generalized likelihood ratio test. We also apply our models to the electric measurements obtained from a phantom body in which an extended electric source is imbedded. We observe that the proposed model can capture the source extent information satisfactorily and the localization accuracy is better than the dipole model. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Introduction. This study examines the EEG spectral power and coherence changes that occur as a result of LORETA neurofeedback (LNFB) training, which is a recently developed spatial-specific neurofeedback protocol in which it has been demonstrated that human beings can learn to change activity in their own anterior cingulate gyrus. We trained individuals to increase low-beta (14-18 Hz) activity in the cognitive division of the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACcd). Methods. This study was conducted with eight non-clinical students with a mean age of 22. The participants completed over 30 sessions of LNFB training. We utilized the WAIS-III for pre- and post-psychometric measures to assess the influence of this training protocol. Results. We selected training Sessions 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 for comparison to Session 1. There are significant increases in absolute power and coherence over sessions. There is significant increase in the working memory and processing speed subtest scores. Discussion. The anterior regions of the cortex increase in the low-beta frequency relative to the ACcd at significant levels. The superior prefrontal cortex and occipital regions increase in the higher beta frequencies, but not in the trained frequency. The improvements in the working memory and processing speed scores suggest that LNFB had an overall positive effect in attentional processes, working memory, and processing speed.

Summary: Neuroelectric and imaging studies of meditation are reviewed. Electroencephalographic measures indicate an overall slowing subsequent to meditation, with theta and alpha activation related to proficiency of practice. Sensory evoked potential assessment of concentrative meditation yields amplitude and latency changes for some components and practices. Cognitive event-related potential evaluation of meditation implies that practice changes attentional allocation. Neuroimaging studies indicate increased regional cerebral blood flow measures during meditation. Taken together, meditation appears to reflect changes in anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal areas. Neurophysiological meditative state and trait effects are variable but are beginning to demonstrate consistent outcomes for research and clinical applications. Psychological and clinical effects of meditation are summarized, integrated, and discussed with respect to neuroimaging data. © 2006 by the American psychological Association.<p>

Summary: Abilities to discriminate forms defined by motion continue to develop throughout childhood. To investigate late development of the visual motion system, we measured brain activity with event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in groups of adolescents (15-17 years) and adults (20-30 years) during a visual form discrimination task-with forms being either defined by motion or luminance contrast. We further explored whether possible developmental changes varied with the degree of motion coherence reflecting maturation specific to global motion processing. Both the fMRI activation patterns and ERP topographies were very similar between adolescents and adults, suggesting that the basic visual networks for processing motion and form are established by the age of 15-17. The ERP response to luminance- and motion-defined forms was dominated by a posterior negativity (N1: 120-270 ms). The N1 of the motion contrast was delayed in adolescents, whereas the N1 of the static condition did not differ between groups. Since the motion-evoked N1 is thought to arise in the middle temporal area MT/V5, our results indicate that visual motion processing in MT continues to get faster, becoming still more efficient during late development. Neither the ERP nor the fMRI results revealed maturation effects specific to motion coherence. This indicates that the specific mechanisms to process global dot motion are already mature in adolescence. The present findings support the view that static perception matures earlier than dynamic perception, and that these visual systems have different developmental courses. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

FASEB Journal 2006;20Summary: Organophosphate pesticides (OPs), known inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), are used extensively throughout the world. Recent studies have focused on the ACHE/PON1 locus as a determinant of inherited susceptibility to environmental OP exposure. To explore the relationship of the corresponding gene-environment interactions with brain activity, we integrated neurophysiologic, neuropsychological, biochemical, and genetic methods. Importantly, we found that subthreshold OP exposure leads to discernible physiological consequences that are significantly influenced by inherited factors. Cortical EEG analyses by LORETA revealed significantly decreased theta activity in the hippocampus, parahippocampal regions, and the cingulate cortex, as well as increased beta activity in the prefrontal cortex of exposed individuals - areas known to play a role in cholinergic-associated cognitive functions. Through neuropsychological testing, we identified an appreciable deficit in the visual recall in exposed individuals. Other neuropsychological tests revealed no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed individuals, attesting to the specificity of our findings. Biochemical analyses of blood samples revealed increases in paraoxonase and arylesterase activities and reduced serum acetylcholinesterase activity in chronically exposed individuals. Notably, specific paraoxonase genotypes were found to be associated with these exposure-related changes in blood enzyme activities and abnormal EEG patterns. Thus, gene-environment interactions involving the ACHE/PON1 locus may be causally involved in determining the physiological response to OP exposure. © FASEB.<p>

Summary: Late development of specialization in the visual word processing system was examined using event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of word and symbol string processing in groups of adolescents (15.2-17.3 years) and adults (19.8-30.8 years). We focused our ERP analyses on fast visual activity: the occipital P1 (82-131 ms) modulated by physical stimulus characteristics and the occipito-temporal N1 (132-256 ms) reflecting visual tuning for print. Our fMRI analyses concentrated on basal occipito-temporal activations in the visual word form area VWFA. For words, the correlation of fMRI activation in the VWFA and N1 amplitude confirmed the close relationship of the electrophysiological N1 with metabolic activity in the VWFA. Further support for this relationship came from low resolution electromagnetic tomography localizing the word-specific N1 near the VWFA. Both imaging techniques revealed age-independent differences between words and symbol strings. Late development, however, was preferentially detected with ERPs. Decreases of P1 and N1 amplitudes with age were not limited to words and suggested further maturation of the underlying brain microstructure and function. Following adolescence, decreasing N1 latencies specific to words point to continued specialization of the visual word processing system. Both N1 and fMRI measures correlated with reading performance. In summary, the similarity of global fMRI activation patterns between groups suggests a fully established distribution of the reading network in adolescence, while the decreasing N1 latencies for words indicate protracted fine tuning after adolescence. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Boehm SG, Klostermann EC, Paller KA: Neural correlates of perceptual contributions to nondeclarative memory for faces. NeuroImage 2006;30:1021-1029.<p>
Summary: Face priming is a nondeclarative memory phenomenon that can be observed when recognition is facilitated for a recently encountered face. This data-driven form of priming is distinct from conceptually driven priming. Moreover, it includes two dissociable components, the facilitated access to pre-existing representations and facilitation in perceptual processing of faces. In the present study, we measured neural correlates of perceptual contributions to face priming with event-related brain potentials. Faces appeared two times (separated by 7-17 s), while participants discriminated familiar from unfamiliar faces. Half of the initial face stimuli were inverted, thereby disrupting perceptual face processing and making possible an assessment of perceptual contributions to face priming. Whereas none of the brain waves previously linked to perceptual processing of faces showed indications of priming, such effects were observed between 200 and 600 ms at left occipito-parieto-temporal recording sites. This electrical activity was present for both unfamiliar and familiar faces. The scalp topography of this effect was consistent with sources within the temporal and occipital cortices of the left hemisphere (based on a LORETA source localization). These findings suggest that priming of perceptual face processing is subserved by prolonged neural activity from 200 to 600 ms primarily in the left hemisphere. We propose that this priming reflects facilitated selection based on second-order relations among facial features. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Bellebaum C, Daum I: Time course of cross-hemispheric spatial updating in the human parietal cortex. Behavioural Brain Research 2006;169:150-161.<p>
Summary: In human parietal cortex, the retinal location of a just seen visual stimulus is updated from one hemisphere to the other, when a horizontal eye movement brings the representation of the stimulus into the opposite visual hemifield. The present study aimed to elucidate the time course of this process. Twelve subjects performed an updating task, in which a filled circle was shown before a horizontal saccade, requiring updating of stimulus location, and a control task without visual stimulation before the saccade. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) were recorded while subjects performed the tasks and LORETA source analysis was performed on event-related potential (ERP) components. ERP amplitudes were more positive in the updating condition in comparison to the control condition in two latency windows. An early positive wave starting at about 50 ms after saccade offset and originating in the posterior parietal cortex contralateral to saccade direction probably reflects the integration of saccade-related and visual information and thus the updating process. A shift of the representation of the to-be-updated stimulus to the opposite hemisphere is reflected in a later component starting approximately 400 ms after saccade offset, which is related to memory and originates in the PPC ipsilateral to saccade direction and thus contralateral to the spatial location of the updated visual stimulus. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Using electroencephalography (EEG), psychophysiology, and psychometric measures, this is the first study which investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of spatial presence. Spatial presence is considered a sense of being physically situated within a spatial environment portrayed by a medium (e.g., television, virtual reality). Twelve healthy children and 11 healthy adolescents were watching different virtual roller coaster scenarios. During a control session, the roller coaster cab drove through a horizontal roundabout track. The following realistic roller coaster rides consisted of spectacular ups, downs, and loops. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) were used to analyze the EEG data. As expected, we found that, compared to the control condition, experiencing a virtual roller coaster ride evoked in both groups strong SP experiences, increased electrodermal reactions, and activations in parietal brain areas known to be involved in spatial navigation. In addition, brain areas that receive homeostatic afferents from somatic and visceral sensations of the body were strongly activated. Most interesting, children (as compared to adolescents) reported higher spatial presence experiences and demonstrated a different frontal activation pattern. While adolescents showed increased activation in prefrontal areas known to be involved in the control of executive functions, children demonstrated a decreased activity in these brain regions. Interestingly, recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies have shown that the frontal brain continues to develop to adult status well into adolescence. Thus, the result of our study implies that the increased spatial presence experience in children may result from the not fully developed control functions of the frontal cortex. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.<p>

<li>Barry RJ, Rushby JA: An orienting reflex perspective on anteriorisation of the p3 of the event-related potential. Experimental Brain Research 2006;173:539-545.<p>
Summary: In the Go/NoGo task, the P3 component of the event-related potential elicited by NoGo stimuli is topographically anterior to that from Go stimuli. This anteriorisation has been linked to the response inhibition thought to be required when NoGo stimuli are presented, and suggested as an index of inhibition. We report a preliminary investigation of this question from an orienting reflex (OR) perspective, in which the autonomic skin conductance response (SCR) was used as an OR &quot;yardstick&quot;. We presented subjects with a random mix of 15 target and 15 non-target auditory stimuli with a short inter-stimulus interval, and explored the sources of the resultant P3s using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Across-subject mean SCRs showed exponential decrement over trials and a larger response to targets, as expected from the OR perspective. LORETA analysis of the across-subject mean initial P3s showed exponential response decrement of their common sources, suggestive of the Novelty P3. Grand mean P3s to targets and non-targets appeared to correspond to the P3b and P3a, respectively. These results suggest that anteriorisation of the P3 to NoGo stimuli may reflect processing related to the basic involuntary OR to indifferent (non-significant) stimuli rather than an active inhibitory process. © Springer-Verlag 2006.<p>

Summary: We propose a novel cerebral source extraction method (functional source separation, FSS) starting from extra-cephalic magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals in humans. It is obtained by adding a functional constraint to the cost function of a basic independent component analysis (ICA) model, defined according to the specific experiment under study, and removing the orthogonality constraint, (i.e., in a single-unit approach, skipping decorrelation of each new component from the subspace generated by the components already found). Source activity was obtained all along processing of a simple separate sensory stimulation of thumb, little finger, and median nerve. Being the sources obtained one by one in each stage applying different criteria, the a posteriori &quot;interesting sources selection&quot; step is avoided. The obtained solutions were in agreement with the homuncular organization in all subjects, neurophysiologically reacting properly and with negligible residual activity. On this basis, the separated sources were interpreted as satisfactorily describing highly superimposed and interconnected neural networks devoted to cortical finger representation. The proposed procedure significantly improves the quality of the extraction with respect to a standard BSS algorithm. Moreover, it is very flexible in including different functional constraints, providing a promising tool to identify neuronal networks in very general cerebral processing. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Bai X, He B: Estimation of number of independent brain electric sources from the scalp eegs. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2006;53:1883-1892.<p>
Summary: In electromagnetic source analysis, many source localization strategies require the number of sources as an input parameter (e.g., spatio-temporal dipole fitting and the multiple signal classification). In the present study, an information criterion method, in which the penalty functions are selected based on the spatio-temporal source model, has been developed to estimate the number of independent dipole sources from electromagnetic measurements such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the estimation of the source number. A three-concentric-spheres head model was used to approximate the head volume conductor. Three kinds of typical signal sources, i.e., the damped sinusoid sources, sinusoid sources with one frequency band and sinusoid sources with two separated frequency bands, were used to simulate the oscillation characteristics of brain electric sources. The simulation results suggest that the present method can provide a good estimate of the number of independent dipole sources from the EEG measurements. In addition, the present simulation results suggest that choosing the optimal penalty function can successfully reduce the effect of noise on the estimation of number of independent sources. The present study suggests that the information criterion method may provide a useful means in estimating the number of independent brain electrical sources from EEG/MEG measurements. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Annals of Neurology 2006;59:323-334.<p>
Summary: Objective: Relationships between the apolipoprotein E ?4 allele and electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythmicity have been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients but not in the preclinical stage prodromic to it, namely, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The present multicentric EEG study tested the hypothesis that presence of ?4 affects sources of resting EEG rhythms in both MCI and AD subjects. Methods: We enrolled 89 MCI subjects (34.8% with ?4) and 103 AD patients (50.4% with ?4). Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded for all subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13Hz), beta 1 (13-20Hz), and beta 2 (20-30Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Results: Results showed that amplitude of alpha 1 and 2 sources in occipital, temporal, and limbic areas was lower in subjects carrying the ?4 allele than in those not carrying the ?4 allele (p &lt; 0.01). This was true for both MCI and AD. For the first time to our knowledge, a relationship was shown between ApoE genotype and global neurophysiological phenotype (ie, cortical alpha rhythmicity) in a preclinical AD condition, MCI, in addition to clinically manifest AD. Interpretation: Such a demonstration motivates future genotype-EEG phenotype studies for the early prediction of AD conversion in individual MCI subjects. © 2006 American Neurological Association.<p>

Summary: The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term stability of auditory N1 sources using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Data collected from 72 electrodes in ten young adult female participants were analyzed. For each participant, N1 peak amplitude and latency values at Cz (referred to M2) were compared for right, left, and bilateral stimulation across three separate recording sessions. Further, sources calculated by LORETA were analyzed in three regions of interest: right temporal, left temporal, and frontal. Peak amplitude and latency measurements were stable across session and ear of stimulation. Three-way RM-ANOVAs revealed relatively stable source amplitudes and stable three-dimensional locations of the sources in each region of interest with shifts of up to 2 cm around the mean locations. The 2 cm variability may be attributable both to normal hemispheric asymmetries and electrode placement variability. These results suggest that N1 scalp activity and its underlying sources are stable. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.<p>

Summary: In this paper, an improved magnetoencephalography (MEG) source reconstruction technique considering anatomical connectivity of cortical sources is proposed. The anatomical connectivity information was taken into account by calculating three-dimensional geodesic distance between neighboring sources, and then the resultant inverse solutions were compared with those of other cases: 1) inverse estimate without connectivity information; 2) use of Euclidean distance instead of geodesic distance. The proposed technique was applied to realistic simulations for a real brain anatomy, and the results showed that estimated sources can be smoother and more accurate by using the anatomical connectivity information. © 2006 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Objective: We have investigated the localization accuracy of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for mesial temporal interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) on a statistical basis by using clinical electroencephalographic (EEG) data of simultaneous scalp and intracranial foramen ovale (FO) electrode recordings. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the IED of 15 patients who underwent presurgical assessment for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. All patients have subsequently undergone amygdalohippocampectomy. The scalp signals were averaged time-locked to the peak activity in bilateral 10-contact FO electrode recordings. Source modeling was carried out by using statistical non-parametric mapping (SNPM) of LORETA values and by calculating raw LORETA values of averaged IED. The results were compared to intracranial data obtained from FO electrode recordings. Results: Two thousand six hundred and fifteen discharges could be attributed to 19 different patterns of intracranial mesial temporal IED. SNPM of LORETA revealed confined ipsilateral mesial temporal solutions for 14 (73.7%) and no significant solutions for five (26.3%) of these patterns. Raw LORETA current density distributions of the 19 averaged IED patterns revealed ipsilateral basal to lateral temporal solutions for the 14 IED patterns with a sufficient signal to noise ratio (SNR), but spurious results for those five IED with a low SNR. Conclusions: SNPM of LORETA but not LORETA analysis of averaged IED patterns accurately localizes the source generators of mesial temporal IEDs. Significance: SNPM of raw LORETA values might be appropriate for localizing restricted mesial temporal lobe sources. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Yvert B, Fischer C, Bertrand O, Pernier J: Localization of human supratemporal auditory areas from intracerebral auditory evoked potentials using distributed source models. NeuroImage 2005;28:140-153.<p>
Summary: While source localization methods are increasingly developed to identify brain areas underlying scalp electro/magnetoencephalographic data (EEG/MEG), these methods have not yet been used to identify the sources of intracerebral signals which offer highly detailed information. Here, we adapted the minimum current estimates method to intracranial data in order to localize supratemporal sources of intracerebral auditory 1-kHz-tone-evoked potentials occurring within 100 ms after stimulus onset. After an evaluation of localization method and despite inter-subject variability, we found a common spatiotemporal pattern of activities, which involved the first Heschl's gyrus (H1) and sulcus (HS), the Planum Temporale (PT), H2/H3 when present, and the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Four time periods of activity were distinguished, corresponding to the time range of the scalp components P0, Na, Pa/Pb, and N100. The sources of the earliest components P0 (16-19 ms) and Na (20-25 ms) could be identified in the postero-medial portion of HS or H1. Then, several areas became simultaneously active after 25 ms. The Pa/Pb time range (30-50 ms) was characterized by a medio-lateral and postero-anterior propagation of activity over the supratemporal plane involving successively H1/HS, the Planum Temporale, H2/H3 when present, and the STG. Finally, we found to a large extent that the N100 (55-100 ms) involved almost the same areas as those active during the Pa/Pb complex, with a similar propagation of activities. Reconstructing scalp data from these sources on fictive EEG/MEG channels reproduced classical auditory evoked waveforms and topographies. In conclusion, the spatiotemporal pattern of activation of supratemporal auditory areas could be identified on the individual anatomy using current estimates from intracerebral data. Such detailed localization approach could also be used prior to epilepsy surgery to help identify epileptogenic foci and preserve functional cortical areas. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Yoshimura N, Kawamura M, Masaoka Y, Homma I: The amygdala of patients with parkinson's disease is silent in response to fearful facial expressions. Neuroscience 2005;131:523-534.<p>
Summary: We previously found that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were impaired with respect to recognition of fear and disgust in facial expressions. To investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie this impairment, we recorded visual event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to the viewing of fearful facial expressions. Ten normal elderly volunteers and nine patients with PD were studied. Fearful, surprised, and neutral facial expressions were presented randomly for 500 ms each, with a probability of 0.1, 0.1, and 0.8, respectively. The locations of the components of the ERPs were analyzed using a scalp-skull-brain/dipole tracing method. The ERPs elicited in response to the facial stimuli consisted of a negative peak (N1), two positive peaks, and a subsequent slow negative shift. For N1, the equivalent current dipoles were concentrated in the fusiform gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate cortex, and cerebellum, in normal subjects. In response to the fearful stimulus, dipoles were also generated from the amygdala in seven out of 10 normal subjects. In contrast, in patients with PD, N1 was centered bilaterally in the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, and there was no neuronal activity in the amygdala. After N1, dipoles moved toward the frontal region in normal subjects, whereas they remained in the parietal lobes in patients with PD. These results suggest that neither the amygdala nor the temporal visual-associated cortices are involved in responding to fearful expressions in patients with PD. Corticostriatal connections may be variably affected by a lack of dopamine or by pathological changes in the amygdala. Thus, somatosensory recruitment may overcome the mild cognitive emotional deficits that are present in patients with PD owing to a dysfunction of the amygdala. © 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

<li>Yao J, Dewald JPA: Evaluation of different cortical source localization methods using simulated and experimental eeg data. NeuroImage 2005;25:369-382.<p>
Summary: Different cortical source localization methods have been developed to directly link the scalp potentials with the cortical activities. Up to now, these methods are the only possible solution to noninvasively investigate cortical activities with both high spatial and time resolutions. However, the application of these methods is hindered by the fact that they have not been rigorously evaluated nor compared. In this paper, the performances of several source localization methods (moving dipoles, minimum Lp norm, and low resolution tomography (LRT) with Lp norm, p equal to 1, 1.5, and 2) were evaluated by using simulated scalp EEG data, scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and upper limb motor-related potentials (MRPs) obtained on human subjects (all with 163 scalp electrodes). By using simulated EEG data, we first evaluated the source localization ability of the above methods quantitatively. Subsequently, the performance of the various methods was evaluated qualitatively by using experimental SEPs and MRPs. Our results show that the overall LRT Lp norm method with p equal to 1 has a better source localization ability than any of the other investigated methods and provides physiologically meaningful reconstruction results. Our evaluation results provide useful information for choosing cortical source localization approaches for future EEG/MEG studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Weber DL, Clark CR, McFarlane AC, Moores KA, Morris P, Egan GF: Abnormal frontal and parietal activity during working memory updating in post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging 2005;140:27-44.<p>
Summary: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the timing and scalp topography of working memory in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study was designed to investigate ERPs associated with a specific working memory updating process. ERPs were recorded from 10 patients and 10 controls during two visual tasks where (a) targets were a specific word or (b) targets were consecutive matching words. In the first task, nontarget words are not retained in working memory. In the second task, as in delay-match-to-sample tasks, a non-target word defines a new target identity, so these words are retained in working memory. This working memory updating process was related to large positive ERPs over frontal and parietal areas at 400-800 ms, which were smaller in PTSD. Estimation of cortical source activity indicated abnormal patterns of frontal and parietal activity in PTSD, which were also observed in regional cerebral blood flow [Clark, C.R., McFarlane, A.C., Morris, P., Weber, D.L., Sonkkilla, C., Shaw, M., Marcina, J., Tochon-Danguy, H., Egan, G., 2003. Cerebral function in posttraumatic stress disorder during verbal working memory updating: a positron emission tomography study. Biological Psychiatry 53, 474-481]. Frontal and parietal cortex are known to be involved in distributed networks for working memory processes, interacting with medial temporal areas during episodic memory processes. Abnormal function in these brain networks helps to explain everyday concentration and memory difficulties in PTSD. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Hebephrenic (disorganized) schizophrenia is an uncommon type characterized by clinical course and symptoms. The pathophysiology and metabolic brain changes (regional brain metabolizm) of this type are not well established. In our case study we present results of 18FDG PET (18F-deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography) and qEEG (quantitative EEG analysis) investigation of an 18-years old man with the first episode of disorganized schizophrenia. METHODS: The regional brain metabolizm was investigated by the use of 18FDG PET in the resting state. The one-sample t-test (SPM99) was used to determine the differences between the hebephrenic patient and the control group of healthy people. The 3D intracerebral distribution of neuronal electrical activity (current density) from the scalp-recorded potential distribution was assessed with Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) qEEG. RESULTS: We found increased metabolism in the uncus, middle and superior temporal gyrus, inferior and middle frontal gyrus and precuneus on the right side, in the left inferior parietal lobulus and superior temporal gyrus and in the occipital regions bilaterally. The lower metabolism (18FDG uptake) was found only in the right precentral gyrus (p = 0.001). In comparison with healthy controls, we found a significantly higher current density in the delta band on the right side particularly in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, inferior temporal and middle occipital gyrus, cuneus and also in limbic structures: in the uncus, posterior cingulum, and insula. On the left side, the current density was higher in superior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, cingulum and precuneus. In the theta band, we identified higher current density in inferior and superior frontal gyrus, inferior part of gyrus praecentralis and superior temporal gyrus. In the beta3 band, we found a significant decrease of current density in the precuneus (p = 0.001). In the frequency bends alfa1 alfa2, beta1 and beta2, we did not found any significant changes in current density. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate the increase of brain metabolism in the right fronto-temporo-limbic and parietal structures as the substrate for the characteristic neurobiological dysfunction in the hebephrenic schizophrenia. The results of quantitative analysis of EEG (LORETA) are in accordance with previous studies focused on metabolic and neurophysiologic changes in schizophrenia.<p>

<li>Thatcher RW, North D, Biver C: Parametric vs. Non-parametric statistics of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (loreta). Clinical EEG and Neuroscience 2005;36:1-8.<p>
Summary: This study compared the relative statistical sensitivity of non-parametric and parametric statistics of 3-dimensional current sources as estimated by the EEG inverse solution Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). One would expect approximately 5% false positives (classification of a normal as abnormal) at the P &lt; .025 level of probability (two tailed test) and approximately 1% false positives at the P &lt; .005 level. EEG digital samples (2 second intervals sampled 128 Hz, 1 to 2 minutes eyes closed) from 43 normal adult subjects were imported into the Key Institute's LORETA program. We then used the Key Institute's cross-spectrum and the Key Institute's LORETA output files (*.lor) as the 2,394 gray matter pixel representation of 3-dimensional currents at different frequencies. The mean and standard deviation *.lor files were computed for each of the 2,394 gray matter pixels for each of the 43 subjects. Tests of Gaussianity and different transforms were computed in order to best approximate a normal distribution for each frequency and gray matter pixel. The relative sensitivity of parametric vs. non-parametric statistics were compared using a &quot;leave-one-out&quot; cross validation method in which individual normal subjects were withdrawn and then statistically classified as being either normal or abnormal based on the remaining subjects. Log10 transforms approximated Gaussian distribution in the range of 95% to 99% accuracy. Parametric Z score tests at P &lt; .05 cross-validation demonstrated an average misclassification rate of approximately 4.25%, and range over the 2,394 gray matter pixels was 27.66% to 0.11%. At P &lt; .01 parametric Z score cross-validation false positives were 0.26% and ranged from 6.65% to 0% false positives. The non-parametric Key Institute's t-max statistic at P &lt; .05 had an average misclassification error rate of 7.64% and ranged from 43.37% to 0.04% false positives. The non-parametric t-max at P &lt; .01 had an average misclassification rate of 6.67% and ranged from 41.34% to 0% false positives of the 2,394 gray matter pixels for any cross-validated normal subject. In conclusion, adequate approximation to Gaussian distribution and high cross-validation can be achieved by the Key Institute's LORETA programs by using a log10 transform and parametric statistics, and parametric normative comparisons had lower false positive rates than the non-parametric tests.<p>

<li>Thatcher RW, North D, Biver C: Evaluation and validity of a loreta normative eeg database. Clinical EEG and Neuroscience 2005;36:116-122.<p>
Summary: To evaluate the reliability and validity of a Z-score normative EEG database for Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), EEG digital samples (2 second intervals sampled 128 Hz, 1 to 2 minutes eyes closed) were acquired from 106 normal subjects, and the cross-spectrum was computed and multiplied by the Key Institute's LORETA 2,394 gray matter pixel T Matrix. After a log10 transform or a Box-Cox transform the mean and standard deviation of the Mor files were computed for each of the 2,394 gray matter pixels, from 1 to 30 Hz, for each of the subjects. Tests of Gaussianity were computed in order to best approximate a normal distribution for each frequency and gray matter pixel. The relative sensitivity of a Z-score database was computed by measuring the approximation to a Gaussian distribution. The validity of the LORETA normative database was evaluated by the degree to which confirmed brain pathologies were localized using the LORETA normative database. Log10 and Box-Cox transforms approximated Gaussian distribution in the range of 95.64% to 99.75% accuracy. The percentage of normative Z-score values at 2 standard deviations ranged from 1.21% to 3.54%, and the percentage of Z-scores at 3 standard deviations ranged from 0% to 0.83%. Left temporal lobe epilepsy, right sensory motor hematoma and a right hemisphere stroke exhibited maximum Z-score deviations in the same locations as the pathologies. We conclude: (1) Adequate approximation to a Gaussian distribution can be achieved using LORETA by using a log10 transform or a Box-Cox transform and parametric statistics, (2) a Z-Score normative database is valid with adequate sensitivity when using LORETA, and (3) the Z-score LORETA normative database also consistently localized known pathologies to the expected Brodmann areas as an hypothesis test based on the surface EEG before computing LORETA.<p>

<li>Teyler TJ, Hamm JP, Clapp WC, Johnson BW, Corballis MC, Kirk IJ: Long-term potentiation of human visual evoked responses. European Journal of Neuroscience 2005;21:2045-2050.<p>
Summary: Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a candidate synaptic mechanism underlying learning and memory that has been studied extensively at the cellular and molecular level in laboratory animals. To date, LTP has only been directly demonstrated in humans in isolated cortical tissue obtained from patients undergoing surgery, where it displays properties identical to those seen in non-human preparations. Inquiry into the functional significance of LTP has been hindered by the absence of a human model. Here we give the first demonstration that the rapid repetitive presentation of a visual checkerboard (a photic 'tetanus') leads to a persistent enhancement of one of the early components of the visual evoked potential in normal humans. The potentiated response is largest in the hemisphere contralateral to the tetanized visual hemifield and is limited to one component of the visual evoked response (the N1b). The selective potentiation of only the N1b component makes overall brain excitability changes unlikely and suggests that the effect is due instead to an LTP process. While LTP is known to exist in the human brain, the ability to elicit LTP from non-surgical patients will provide a human model system allowing the detailed examination of synaptic plasticity in normal subjects and may have future clinical applications in the assessment of cognitive disorders. © 2005 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.<p>

Summary: Objective: Definition of appropriate frequency bands and choice of recording reference limit the interpretability of quantitative EEG, which may be further compromised by distorted topographies or inverted hemispheric asymmetries when employing conventional (non-linear) power spectra. In contrast, fPCA factors conform to the spectral structure of empirical data, and a surface Laplacian (2-dimensional CSD) simplifies topographies by minimizing volume-conducted activity. Conciseness and interpretability of EEG and CSD fPCA solutions were compared for three common scaling methods. Methods: Resting EEG and CSD (30 channels, nose reference, eyes open/closed) from 51 healthy and 93 clinically-depressed adults were simplified as power, log power, and amplitude spectra, and summarized using unrestricted, Varimax-rotated, covariance-based fPCA. Results: Multiple alpha factors were separable from artifact and reproducible across subgroups. Power spectra produced numerous, sharply-defined factors emphasizing low frequencies. Log power spectra produced fewer, broader factors emphasizing high frequencies. Solutions for amplitude spectra showed optimal intermediate tuning, particularly when derived from CSD rather than EEG spectra. These solutions were topographically distinct, detecting multiple posterior alpha generators but excluding the dorsal surface of the frontal lobes. Instead a low alpha/theta factor showed a secondary topography along the frontal midline. Conclusions: CSD amplitude spectrum fPCA solutions provide simpler, reference-independent measures that more directly reflect neuronal activity. Significance: A new quantitative EEG approach affording spectral components is developed that closely parallels the concept of an ERP component in the temporal domain. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Tao JX, Ray A, Hawes-Ebersole S, Ebersole JS: Intracranial eeg substrates of scalp eeg interictal spikes. Epilepsia 2005;46:669-676.<p>
Summary: Purpose: To determine the area of cortical generators of scalp EEG interictal spikes, such as those in the temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: We recorded simultaneously 26 channels of scalp EEG with subtemporal supplementary electrodes and 46 to 98 channels of intracranial EEG in 16 surgery candidates with temporal lobe epilepsy. Cerebral discharges with and without scalp EEG correlates were identified, and the area of cortical sources was estimated from the number of electrode contacts demonstrating concurrent depolarization. Results: We reviewed ~?00 interictal spikes recorded with intracranial EEG. Only a very few of these cortical spikes were associated with scalp recognizable potentials; 90% of cortical spikes with a source area of &gt; 10 cm2 produced scalp EEG spikes, whereas only 10% of cortical spikes having &lt; 10 cm2 of source area produced scalp potentials. Intracranial spikes with &lt;6 cm2 of area were never associated with scalp EEG spikes. Conclusions: Cerebral sources of scalp EEG spikes are larger than commonly thought. Synchronous or at least temporally overlapping activation of 10-20 cm2 of gyral cortex is common. The attenuating property of the skull may actually serve a useful role in filtering out all but the most significant interictal discharges that can recruit substantial surrounding cortex. © 2005 International League Against Epilepsy.<p>

<li>Szelenberger W, Piotrowski T, Da?browska AJ: Increased prefrontal event-related current density after sleep deprivation. Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis 2005;65:19-28.<p>
Summary: To investigate how partial sleep loss affects temporal and spatial pattern of information flow, we analyzed sources of brain electrical activity during continuous attention test. Sixteen physicians recruited from the university hospitals participated in the study. Each participant served as his own control. All participants underwent two test sessions including the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), and the Continuous Attention Test (CAT). The CAT items were used as stimuli in event-related potential (ERP) recordings. EEG was recorded from 21 electrodes, according to the international 10-20 system. The sources of bioelectrical activity were computed with low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Estimated sleep time was significantly shorter on nights spent on duty than on nights of normal sleep at home. Sleep loss resulted in significant increase in SSS and BDI scoring, and impairment of immediate recall. Performance on the CAT remained relatively intact. Under the sleep loss condition compared to baseline, significant differences in brain activity occurred only for targets. Within the P1 time frame, sleep loss led to greater activation in the right Brodmann's area 9/10. For the N1 component, significant differences were localized on the lateral surface of the right frontal lobe, in Brodmann's areas 8 and 9. No significant effects of sleep deprivation on the P3 component were found. Our results are consistent with earlier data indicating that increased activation of the prefrontal cortex allows the maintainance of performance during periods of sleep loss.<p>

<li>Stevens MC, Calhoun VD, Kiehl KA: Hemispheric differences in hemodynamics elicited by auditory oddball stimuli. NeuroImage 2005;26:782-792.<p>
Summary: Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the right hemisphere of the human brain might be more specialized for attention than the left hemisphere. However, differences between right and left hemisphere in the magnitude of hemodynamic activity (i.e., 'functional asymmetry') rarely have been explicitly examined in previous neuroimaging studies of attention. This study used a new voxel-based comparison method to examine hemispheric differences in the amplitude of the hemodynamic response in response to infrequent target, infrequent novel, and frequent standard stimuli during an event-related fMRI auditory oddball task in 100 healthy adult participants. Processing of low probability task-relevant target stimuli, or 'oddballs', and low probability task-irrelevant novel stimuli is believed to engage in orienting and attentional processes. It was hypothesized that greater right-hemisphere activation compared to left would be observed to infrequent target and novel stimuli. Consistent with predictions, greater right hemisphere than left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe activity was observed for target detection and novelty processing. Moreover, asymmetry effects did not differ with respect to age or gender of the participants. The results (1) support the proposal that the right hemisphere is differentially engaged in processing salient stimuli and (2) demonstrate the successful use of a new voxel-based laterality analysis technique for fMRI data.<p>

<li>Stevens MC, Calhoun VD, Kiehl KA: Fmri in an oddball task: Effects of target-to-target interval. Psychophysiology 2005;42:636-642.<p>
Summary: The amplitude of the P3 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by task-relevant target (&quot;oddball&quot;) stimuli has been shown to vary in proportion to the length of time between targets. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify neural systems modulated by target interval in a large sample of healthy adults (n=100) during performance of an auditory oddball task that included both target and novel stimuli. A positive relationship was found between target interval and hemodynamic activity in the anterior cingulate and in bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex, temporal-parietal junction, postcentral gryi, thalamus, and cerebellum. This modulation likely represents updating of the working memory template for the target stimuli. There was no such effect of novel interval, suggesting that neuronal modulation may only occur for task-relevant stimuli, possibly in the service of strategic resource allocation processes.

<li>Soufflet L, Boeijinga PH: Linear inverse solutions: Simulations from a realistic head model in meg. Brain Topography 2005;18:87-99.<p>
Summary: Distributed linear solutions are widely used in source localization to solve the ill-posed EEG/MEG inverse problem. In the classical approach based on dipole sources, these methods estimate the current densities at a great number of brain sites, typically at the nodes of a 3-D grid which discretizes the chosen solution space. The estimated current density distributions are displayed as brain electromagnetic tomography (BET) images. We have tested well known minimum norm solutions (MN, WMN, LORETA) and other linear inverse solutions [WROP, sLORETA, interference uniform, gain uniform, weight vector normalized (WVN), and a new solution named SLF (Standardized Lead Field)], using a MEG configuration (BTi Magnes 2500 WH with 148 axial magnetometers) and a realistic head model using BEM (Boundary Element Method). The solutions were compared in a noise-free condition and in the presence of noise using the classical dipole localization errors (DLE) together with a new figure of merit that we called max gain uniformity, which measures the capability of an inverse linear solution to show spots of activity with similar amplitudes on the brain electromagnetic tomographies when multiple dipole sources with similar moments are simultaneously active. Whereas some solutions (sLORETA, interference uniform and SLF) were capable of zero dipole localization errors in the noise-free case, none of them reached 100% of correct dipole localizations in the presence of a high level of Gaussian noise. The SLF solution, which has the advantage to be independent from any regularisation parameter, presented the best results with the lowest max gain uniformities, with almost 100% of correct dipole localizations with 10% of noise and more than 90% of correct localizations with 30% of noise added to the data. Nevertheless, no solution was able to combine at the same time a correct localization of single sources and the capability to visualize multiple sources with comparable amplitudes on the brain electromagnetic tomographies.

Summary: Though neuropsychological data indicate that the right hemisphere (RH) plays a major role in metaphor processing, other studies suggest that, at least during some phases of this processing, a RH advantage may not exist. The present study explores, through a temporally agile neural signal - the event-related potentials (ERPs) -, and through source-localization algorithms applied to ERP recordings, whether the crucial phase of metaphor comprehension presents or not a RH advantage. Participants (n = 24) were submitted to a S1-S2 experimental paradigm. S1 consisted of visually presented metaphoric sentences (e.g., &quot;Green lung of the city&quot;), followed by S2, which consisted of words that could (i.e., &quot;Park&quot;) or could not (i.e., &quot;Semaphore&quot;) be defined by S1. ERPs elicited by S2 were analyzed using temporal principal component analysis (tPCA) and source-localization algorithms. These analyses revealed that metaphorically related S2 words showed significantly higher N400 amplitudes than non-related S2 words. Source-localization algorithms showed differential activity between the two S2 conditions in the right middle/superior temporal areas. These results support the existence of an important RH contribution to (at least) one phase of metaphor processing and, furthermore, implicate the temporal cortex with respect to that contribution. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Event-related potentials to infrequently presented spoken deviant syllables /pi/ and /po/ among repetitive standard /pinverted c sign/ syllables were recorded in Thai study participants who ignored these stimuli while reading books of their choices. The vowel across-category and within-category changes elicited a change-specific mismatch negativity response. The across-category and within-category change discrimination of vowels in consonant-vowel syllable was also assessed using the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. The results of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography mismatch negativity generator analysis suggest that the within-category change perception of vowels is analyzed as the change in physical features of the stimuli, thus predominantly activating the right temporal cortex. In contrast, the left temporal cortex is predominantly activated in the across-category change perception of vowels, emphasizing the role of the left hemisphere in speech processing already at a preattentive processing level also in consonant-vowel syllables. The results support the hypothesis that a part of the superior temporal gyrus contains neurons specialized for speech perception. © 2005 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

Summary: Different psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia with predominantly positive and negative symptomatology, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, multi-infarct dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and alcohol dependence, show EEG maps that differ statistically both from each other and from normal controls. Representative drugs of the main psychopharmacological classes, such as sedative and non-sedative neuroleptics and antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, psychostimulants and cognition-enhancing drugs, induce significant and typical changes to normal human brain function, which in many variables are opposite to the above-mentioned differences between psychiatric patients and normal controls. Thus, by considering these differences between psychotropic drugs and placebo in normal subjects, as well as between mental disorder patients and normal controls, it may be possible to choose the optimum drug for a specific patient according to a key-lock principle, since the drug should normalize the deviant bran function. This is supported by 3-dimensional low-resolution bran electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), which identifies regions within the brain that are affected by psychiatric disorders and psychopharmacological substances.<p>

Summary: Rationale: Daytime fatigue, which at the neurophysiological level is due to vigilance decrements, is a frequent complaint in postmenopausal women. Objectives: In a three-arm, 2-month, parallel group-design study, vigilance-promoting effects of a novel continuous combination (=Climodien 2/3) of estradiol valerate (EV; 2 mg) and dienogest (DNG; 3 mg) were compared with the effects of both EV alone and placebo in 55 insomniac, postmenopausal syndrome patients. Methods: Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was undertaken to identify the cerebral target regions of hormone replacement therapy. Results: An omnibus significance test revealed Climodien to increase activity in 882 of 2,394 voxels in the alpha-2 band, followed by 733, 706, and 664 voxels in the beta-2, beta-1, and beta-3 bands, and 509 voxels in the delta band, whereas 2 mg EV alone did not produce a significant suprathreshold activity. Current density increased predominantly in the right hemisphere, which had already been described in the literature as the center of the vigilance system. In the fast alpha range, which plays a major role in the context of vigilance, increased activity was found in the right prefrontal, temporal, and superior parietal cortices, i.e., those brain areas of the right-sided fronto-parietal neuronal network that are responsible for sustained attention. A further activity increase was seen in the anterior cingulate gyrus associated with attentional control and conflict monitoring. The right temporal lobe showed increased current density in all frequency bands. Conclusions: Electroencephalographic tomography (LORETA) identified the right-hemispheric vigilance system as the target region of Climodien. © Springer-Verlag 2004.<p>

Summary: Perceptual load of an attended task influences the processing of irrelevant background stimuli. In a series of behavioral, functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments we examined the influence of working memory (WM) load related to a relevant visual stimulus on the processing of irrelevant backgrounds. We further addressed two open questions about the mechanism of load-dependent modulation: (i) is this modulation dependent on regional activity (i.e. phasic)? (ii) At what processing stage does this modulation take place? Load was manipulated by a WM task and concurrently the processing of irrelevant visual objects was assessed with fMRI and EEG. To examine the dependency of this modulation on intrinsic activity, we varied the activity level of visual areas by presenting objects with different levels of degradation. Activity in the lateral occipital complex (LOC) increased with object visibility and was phasically modulated by WM load. Event related potentials revealed that this phasic modulation occurred ?170 ms after stimulus onset, indicative of an early selection under high load. The results indicate a phasic modulatory effect of WM load on visual object processing in the LOC that is comparable to the effects found for perceptual load manipulations. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.<p>

<li>Riba J, Barbanoj MJ: Bringing ayahuasca to the clinical research laboratory. Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 2005;37:219-230.<p>
Summary: Since the winter of 1999, the authors and their research team have been conducting clinical studies involving the administration of ayahuasca to healthy volunteers. The rationale for conducting this kind of research is twofold. First, the growing interest of many individuals for traditional indigenous practices involving the ingestion of natural psychotropic drugs such as ayahuasca demands the systematic study of their pharmacological profiles in the target species, i.e., human beings. The complex nature of ayahuasca brews combining a large number of pharmacologically active compounds requires that research be carried out to establish the safety and overall pharmacological profile of these products. Second, the authors believe that the study of psychedelics in general calls for renewed attention. Although the molecular and electrophysiological level effects of these drugs are relatively well characterized, current knowledge of the mechanisms by which these compounds modify the higher order cognitive processes in the way they do is still incomplete, to say the least. The present article describes the development of the research effort carried out at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, commenting on several methodological aspects and reviewing the basic clinical findings. It also describes the research currently underway in our laboratory, and briefly comments on two new studies we plan to undertake in order to further our knowledge of the phrmacology of ayahuasca.<p>

Summary: Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have provided evidence that a frontal network including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in attention and awareness. Disturbed attention and awareness are core symptoms of delirium, but imaging studies of attentional dysfunctions in delirium are lacking. However, an increase of slow electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (delta, theta) is a consistent biological finding in delirium. The question whether this slow activity is related to a disturbance in the frontal attentional network has not yet been addressed. The delirium after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been investigated using 32-channel resting EEG before and shortly after ECT in 12 patients with major depressive disorder. During delirium compared with baseline studies, substantial increases of delta and theta power and a decrease of alpha power were observed. The decrease of theta activity at the Fz electrode position in the following 24 h was significantly related to the recovery of awareness and performance of free recall. Source analysis with Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) indicated that the main generators of the theta excess during delirium were significantly localized in the anterior cingulate cortex, and additionally in right fronto-temporal brain areas. The results support the concept that a disturbance of attention and awareness during delirium is related to a dysfunction of an attentional network involving the ACC. However, the localization of the theta excess may reflect some motor dysfunctions as well. This dysfunction of the ACC was shown for the first time in patients during a delirious state and may represent an important pathophysiological aspect of delirium. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Pratt H, Bleich N, Mittelman N: The composite n1 component to gaps in noise. Clinical Neurophysiology 2005;116:2648-2663.<p>
Summary: Objective: To indicate whether the double peaked N1 to gaps in continuous white noise is a composite of onset and offset responses to transients or whether it reflects higher processing such as change or mismatch detection and to assess the role of attention in this process. Methods: Evoked potentials were recorded to two binaural stimulus types: (1) gaps of different durations randomly distributed in continuous white noise; and (2) click pairs at intervals identical to those between gap onsets and offsets in the continuous noise stimulus. Potentials to these stimuli were recorded while subjects read a text and while detecting gaps in noise or click pairs. Results: Potentials were detected to all click pairs and to gaps of 5 ms or longer, corresponding to the subjects' psychoacoustic gap detection threshold. With long gap durations of 200-800 ms, distinct potentials to gap onset and gap offset were observed. The waveforms to all click pairs and to offsets of long gaps were similar and single-peaked, while potentials to gaps of 10 ms and longer, and potentials to onsets of long gaps were double-peaked, consisting of two N1 negativities, 60 ms apart, irrespective of gap duration. The first (N 1a), was more frontal in its distribution and similar to that of clicks. The second (N1b) peak's distribution was more central/temporal and its source locations and time course of activity were distinct. No effects of attention on any of the varieties and constituents of N1 were observed. Conclusions: Comparing potentials to gap onsets, to click pairs and to gap offsets, suggests that potentials to gap onsets involve not only sound onset/offset responses (N1, N1a) but also the subsequent pre-attentive perception of the cessation of an ongoing sound (N1b). We propose that N1b is distinct from change or mismatch detection and is associated with termination of an ongoing continuous stimulus. We propose to call it the N(egation)-process. Significance: A constituent of the N1 complex is shown to be associated with the pre-attentive perception of termination of an ongoing stimulus and to have distinct scalp distribution and intracranial sources. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Phillips C, Mattout J, Rugg MD, Maquet P, Friston KJ: An empirical bayesian solution to the source reconstruction problem in eeg. NeuroImage 2005;24:997-1011.<p>
Summary: Distributed linear solutions of the EEG source localisation problem are used routinely. In contrast to discrete dipole equivalent models, distributed linear solutions do not assume a fixed number of active sources and rest on a discretised fully 3D representation of the electrical activity of the brain. The ensuing inverse problem is underdetermined and constraints or priors are required to ensure the uniqueness of the solution. In a Bayesian framework, the conditional expectation of the source distribution, given the data, is attained by carefully balancing the minimisation of the residuals induced by noise and the improbability of the estimates as determined by their priors. This balance is specified by hyperparameters that control the relative importance of fitting and conforming to various constraints. Here we formulate the conventional &quot;Weighted Minimum Norm&quot; (WMN) solution in terms of hierarchical linear models. An &quot;Expectation-Maximisation&quot; (EM) algorithm is used to obtain a &quot;Restricted Maximum Likelihood&quot; (ReML) estimate of the hyperparameters, before estimating the &quot;Maximum a Posteriori&quot; solution itself. This procedure can be considered a generalisation of previous work that encompasses multiple constraints. Our approach was compared with the &quot;classic&quot; WMN and Maximum Smoothness solutions, using a simplified 2D source model with synthetic noisy data. The ReML solution was assessed with four types of source location priors: no priors, accurate priors, inaccurate priors, and both accurate and inaccurate priors. The ReML approach proved useful as: (1) The regularisation (or influence of the a priori source covariance) increased as the noise level increased. (2) The localisation error (LE) was negligible when accurate location priors were used. (3) When accurate and inaccurate location priors were used simultaneously, the solution was not influenced by the inaccurate priors. The ReML solution was then applied to real somatosensory-evoked responses to illustrate the application in an empirical setting. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Perfetti CA, Liu Y: Orthography to phonology and meaning: Comparisons across and within writing systems. Reading and Writing 2005;18:193-210.<p>
Summary: According to the Universal Writing System Constraint, all writing systems encode language, and thus reflect basic properties of the linguistic system they encode. According to a second universal, the Universal Phonological Principle, the activation of word pronunciations occurs for skilled readers across all writing systems. We review recent research that illustrates the implications of these two universal principles both across and within writing systems. Within the family of alphabetic systems, differences between Korean and English arise in the languages, rather than the orthographies, while the reverse appears to be true for German and English differences. Across writing systems, new Event Related Potentials (ERP) experiments show the robustness of phonology across Chinese and English systems and chart the time course of word reading in Chinese and English for Chinese bilinguals and for English speakers learning Chinese. The ERP results show differences between Chinese and English for both groups and suggest that the time course of word processes and the brain areas identified as sources for the ERP components differ both as a result of writing system and the skill of the reader. We propose the System Accommodation Hypothesis, that reading processes and the neural structures that support them accommodate to specific visual and structural features of a new writing system. © Springer 2005.<p>

<li>Penny WD, Trujillo-Barreto NJ, Friston KJ: Bayesian fmri time series analysis with spatial priors. NeuroImage 2005;24:350-362.<p>
Summary: We describe a Bayesian estimation and inference procedure for fMRI time series based on the use of General Linear Models (GLMs). Importantly, we use a spatial prior on regression coefficients which embodies our prior knowledge that evoked responses are spatially contiguous and locally homogeneous. Further, using a computationally efficient Variational Bayes framework, we are able to let the data determine the optimal amount of smoothing. We assume an arbitrary order Auto-Regressive (AR) model for the errors. Our model generalizes earlier work on voxel-wise estimation of GLM-AR models and inference in GLMs using Posterior Probability Maps (PPMs). Results are shown on simulated data and on data from an event-related fMRI experiment. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Olbrich HM, Maes H, Valerius G, Langosch JM, Feige B: Event-related potential correlates selectively reflect cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenics. Journal of Neural Transmission 2005;112:283-295.<p>
Summary: Schizophrenics show event-related potential (ERP) and particularly P3 abnormalities. To study the more detailed relationships between these ERP alterations and cognitive dysfunction we recorded and analyzed ERPs using a particular experimental approach. In 34 schizophrenics and 25 controls ERPs were obtained by a visual Go/Nogo task requiring response inhibition and were decomposed into temporally independent topographical components using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). ICA disentangled different subcomponents of P3. Subcomponent P3b with a parietal maximum amplitude was significantly reduced in the schizophrenics, probably reflecting their attentional deficits. Subcomponent P3ng with a frontal maximum amplitude and enhanced during Nogo condition appeared as an electrophysiological index of response inhibition. A significantly reduced P3ng enhancement, found in schizophrenics, probably reflects their impaired response control. Conclusions: ICA can successfully identify ERP subcomponents with distinct scalp topographies representing significant differential indices of normal and abnormal cognitive processing. Involvement of frontal brain areas in disturbed executive control in schizophrenics is supported by our ICA findings. © Springer-Verlag 2004.<p>

<li>Okamoto M, Dan I: Automated cortical projection of head-surface locations for transcranial functional brain mapping. NeuroImage 2005;26:18-28.<p>
Summary: Recent advancements in two noninvasive transcranial neuroimaging techniques, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), signify the increasing importance of establishing structural compatibility between transcranial methods and conventional tomographic methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The transcranial data obtained from the head surface should be projected onto the cortical surface to present the transcranial brain-mapping data on the same platform as tomographic methods. Thus, we developed two transcranial projection algorithms that project given head-surface points onto the cortical surface in structural images, and computer programs based on them. The convex-hull algorithm features geometric handling of the cortical surface, while the balloon-inflation algorithm is faster, and better reflects the local cortical structure. The automatic cortical projection methods proved to be as effective as the manual projection method described in our previous study. These methods achieved perfect correspondence between any given point on the head surface or a related nearby point in space, and its cortical projection point. Moreover, we developed a neighbor-reference method that enables transcranial cortical projection of a given head-surface point in reference to three neighboring points and one additional standard point, even when no structural image of the subject is available. We also calculated an error factor associated with these probabilistic estimations. The current study presents a close topological link between transcranial and tomographic brain-mapping modalities, which could contribute to inter-modal data standardization. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Ofek E, Pratt H: Neurophysiological correlates of subjective significance. Clinical Neurophysiology 2005;116:2354-2362.<p>
Summary: Objective: The neural substrates of emotional response have traditionally been studied using universal sets of emotionally loaded stimuli, regardless of their subjective significance for the individual subject. Related brain activity has been typically traced with fMRI's temporal resolution of seconds. In this study, unique brain responses to subjectively significant stimuli were analyzed and traced with millisecond temporal resolution. Methods: Electrical brain activity (event related potentials) was recorded from 16 normal subjects, to subjectively significant auditory stimuli and its brain sources were imaged. Subjective significance of the stimuli was individually assessed for each subject. Results: Unique and significant brain activity to subjectively significant stimuli began as early as 200 ms after stimulus onset, with increased brain activity in the vicinity of several brain areas, including frontal gyri, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, insula, precuneus and cingulate gyri. The time course of activity in these areas was traced and found concurrent. Conclusions: Although the subjectively significant stimuli of this study were not divided according to their positive or negative affective valence, they elicited a distinct brain response compared to neutral stimuli, with a uniform pattern across subjects. Significance: These results demonstrate that subjectively significant stimuli are associated with characteristic brain activity, that studying the neural substrate and time course of processing subjectively significant stimuli is feasible and that the neurophysiological manifestations of emotions are attainable. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Oddy BW, Barry RJ, Johnstone SJ, Clarke AR: Removal of cnv effects from the n2 and p3 erp components in a visual go/nogo task. Journal of Psychophysiology 2005;19:24-34.<p>
Summary: In an S1-S2 Go/NoGo task the impact of slow potentials following S1, particularly the late component of the contingent negative variation (CNV), on the following cognitive-processing waveforms to S2 (e.g., N2 and P3) remains unclear. A common method to correct for these confounding slow waves has used a forced baseline shortly before S2. The impact of this on ERP measures relating to S2 is unclear. An earlier method of CNV correction, devised to remove its effect on P3 measures by using different baselines for each condition, appears questionable. This study explored the removal of the CNV from both Go and NoGo waveforms to clarify the sensory and cognitive components elicited by S2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the ERP means, and a component relating to the CNV was subtracted from each subject's raw data for each site and condition. Results showed that this effectively removed the CNV without distortion of the S2 ERP morphology. This technique may prove useful in the analysis of the N2 and P3 as indicators of processes involved in response inhibition. © 2005 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.<p>

Summary: The interictal state between two electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions is clinically characterised by possible cognitive adverse effects like mild amnestic syndrome. ECT-induced mnestic deficits can persist for several weeks after ECT. Electrophysiologically, slowing of brain electrical activity in the interictal state has often been reported. Especially, for bilateral ECT a correlation between enhanced left frontotemporal theta activity and retrograde amnesia has been demonstrated. This study focuses on the topographic distribution of cortical slow-wave oscillations during the interictal state of a bilateral ECT cycle. Twelve patients with major depression have been investigated with 32-channel resting EEG 24 h after the 6th ECT session. As controls, 8 major depressive patients were investigated prior to antidepressive treatment. The generating sources of slow-wave activity are estimated within the theta frequency band with low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Source analysis revealed a distinct pattern of theta activity in the depth of the left temporal lobe (fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, Brodmann areas 37 and 36, respectively; p&lt; 0.05) during the interictal state. This finding suggests a dysfunction of the left medial temporal lobe memory system during the interictal state of a bilateral ECT cycle. It will further be discussed whether it is possible to obtain information about activity of deep brain structures like the hippocampal formation from scalp-recorded signals. Copyright © 2005 S.

Summary: The function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been discussed in the last years in the context of conflict monitoring and error detection. In addition, ACC activity has been described in the context of &quot;conscious effort&quot;. Recent neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have described a negative correlation between ACC activity and reaction times in simple or choice reaction time experiments. One suggested explanation for this finding has been that there is a relationship between effort and ACC activity. The present ERP-LORETA study of healthy volunteers (n=35) was intended to directly investigate this relationship. In this experiment, three conditions were investigated: condition I was a choice reaction task with the instruction to stay relaxed during the task (relaxed condition), condition II was the same choice reaction task with the instruction to press the respective button as fast and correct as possible (effort condition). Condition III was just listening to the tones without button press (control condition). Subjects had to score directly after each experimental run on a visual analogue scale the amount of effort they have actually spent. The subjects showed significantly shorter reaction times during the high effort condition in comparison to the relaxed condition, as well as increased N1 amplitudes and increased ACC activity. In a subgroup analysis, this effect was present only in subjects who were (according to their self-ratings) following the instructions closely. These results provide direct evidence for a close relationship between conscious effort and ACC activity and suggest the usefulness of the applied effort-self-rating. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Sound level dependence has been investigated for years with event-related potentials (ERP). A serotonergic modulation of the sound level dependence only of the primary auditory cortex but not of the auditory association cortex has been suggested by a number of clinical and preclinical studies. Therefore, a precise covering of the activity of the primary auditory cortex seems necessary if sound level dependence is used as an indicator of the central serotonergic system. Recent fMRI studies described a pronounced sound level dependence only in the Heschl gyrus/primary auditory cortex but not in auditory association areas. In the present simultaneous 61-channel EEG and fMRI study investigating fourteen healthy subjects, we found a high correlation between the loudness-dependent change of the extent of fMRI activation (number of activated voxels) and the corresponding changes of the mean current source density within the same region of interest covering the primary auditory cortex (r = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest a close relationship between the fMRI signal and event-related potential activity. In addition, the correspondence of the ERP-based data and the fMRI results further supports the validity of the ERP localization approach. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: The hypothesis that psychotic experiences in healthy subjects are associated with a dysfunction of the right hemisphere is supported by some, but not all, available studies. Differences in gender composition of study samples may explain in part the divergent findings. The present study was carried out in 42 healthy, right-handed university students. Scores on the Schizophrenia and Paranoia scales of the Minnesota Multidimensional Personality Inventory-2 were used in correlation analyses and to define a High- and a Low-Psychotic group. Brain Electrical Microstates and Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) source analyses of the auditory P300 (P3a and P3b) components of the event-related potential, as well as a battery of neuropsychological tests, were used to assess hemispheric functioning. Scores on the Paranoia scale were positively associated with a leftward shift of the P3a topographic descriptors in females but not in males. When comparing High-Psychotic and Low-Psychotic females, a leftward shift of P3a descriptors and an increased cortical activation in left fronto-temporal areas were observed in the High-Psychotic group. Our results demonstrated gender-related differences in the pattern of hemispheric imbalance associated with psychotic experiences in healthy subjects. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Objective: To determine the generality of auditory processing impairment in phonologic dyslexics by studying their auditory Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and the spatio-temporal distribution of their brain activity to auditory linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli with temporal and spectral discriminating cues. Methods: Fourteen adult phonologic dyslexics and 14 normal reading students, all with high academic achievements, were compared. ERP waveform analysis and current density source estimation (Low resolution Electromagnetic Tomographic Analysis-LORETA) were conducted on 21-channel records from subjects who passively listened or actively discriminated 4 types of auditory stimuli: linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli that differed in spectral or temporal characteristics. Results: Significant differences were found for all ERP latencies (N1, P2, N2, P3) in response to all stimuli, with dyslexics presenting longer latencies compared to normal readers. Current density distributions and their time courses also differed significantly, regardless of stimulus type or attention allocation. Among normal readers, early activity (around N1) was characterized by a rapid change of maximum activity from right to left temporal lobe. Later activity (around P3) was characterized by a stable temporal activity with bilaterally synchronous peak activity. Among the dyslexics, the early N1 activity was stable with left hemisphere prominence, with no alternation between the hemispheres, while the later P3 activity peaked earlier in the right hemisphere than in the left. Conclusions: Dyslexics were different from controls in processing all auditory stimuli: verbal and non-verbal stimuli with temporal as well as with spectral discriminating cues. The differences mainly consisted of latency and time courses of current density distributions, beginning as early as N1 and extending to the late P3. Significance: Differences in processing auditory stimuli by phonologic dyslexics are not restricted to linguistic (phonological) stimuli, supporting a general auditory processing impairment in phonologic dyslexia. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Maurer U, Brem S, Bucher K, Brandeis D: Emerging neurophysiological specialization for letter strings. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 2005;17:1532-1552.<p>
Summary: In adult readers, printed words and other letter strings activate specialized visual functions within 200 msec, as evident from neurophysiological recordings of brain activity. These fast, specialized responses to letter strings are thought to develop through plastic changes in the visual system. However, it is unknown whether this specialization emerges only with the onset of word reading, or represents a precursor of literacy. We compared 6-year-old kindergarten children who could not yet read words to adult readers. Both age groups detected immediate repetitions of visually presented words, pseudowords, symbol strings, and pictures during event-related potential (ERP) mapping. Maps from seven corresponding ERP segments in children and adults were analyzed regarding fast (&lt;250 msec) and slow (&gt;300 msec) specialization for letter strings. Adults reliably differentiated words through increased fast (&lt;150 msec) occipito-temporal N1 activity from symbols. Children showed a later, more mid-occipital N1 with marginal word-symbol differences, which were absent in those children with low letter knowledge. Children with high letter knowledge showed some fast sensitivity to letter strings, which was confined to right occipito-temporal sites, unlike the stronger adult N1 specialization. This suggests that a critical degree of early literacy induces some immature, but fast, specialization for letter strings before word reading becomes possible. Children also differentiated words from symbols in later segments through increased right occipito-temporal negativity for words. This slow specialization for letter strings was not modulated by letter knowledge and was absent in adults, possibly reflecting a visual precursor of literacy due to visual familiarity with letter strings. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<p>

Summary: Slow electrophysiological effects, which fluctuate throughout the course of a sentence, independent of transient responses to individual words, have been reported. However, this type of activity has scarcely been studied, and with only limited use of electrophysiological information, so that the brain areas in which these variations originate have not been clearly identified. To improve this state of affairs, a principal component analysis and a modern source analysis algorithm (LORETA) were applied to the slow activity underlying transitive sentence reading. Four components explained 97.3% of the variance. Of key interest was a slow variation that occurred throughout the entire sentence but peaked with the appearance of the verb. The main solution for this component was localized in prefrontal and temporal regions presumably involved in semantic sentence processing. This constitutes empirical evidence for cortical activity-related to semantic processes thought to be involved in thematic role assignment-developing throughout the sentence but presenting a conspicuous maximum with the appearance of the verb. This finding also highlights the central role of verb information in the understanding of transitive sentences. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Marco-Pallare?s J, Grau C, Ruffini G: Combined ica-loreta analysis of mismatch negativity. NeuroImage 2005;25:471-477.<p>
Summary: A major challenge for neuroscience is to map accurately the spatiotemporal patterns of activity of the large neuronal populations that are believed to underlie computing in the human brain. To study a specific example, we selected the mismatch negativity (MMN) brain wave (an event-related potential, ERP) because it gives an electrophysiological index of a &quot;primitive intelligence&quot; capable of detecting changes, even abstract ones, in a regular auditory pattern. ERPs have a temporal resolution of milliseconds but appear to result from mixed neuronal contributions whose spatial location is not fully understood. Thus, it is important to separate these sources in space and time. To tackle this problem, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution tomography (LORETA) algorithms. Here we implement this approach to analyze the subsecond spatiotemporal dynamics of MMN cerebral sources using trial-by-trial experimental data. We show evidence that a cerebral computation mechanism underlies MMN. This mechanism is mediated by the orchestrated activity of several spatially distributed brain sources located in the temporal, frontal, and parietal areas, which activate at distinct time intervals and are grouped in six main statistically independent components. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: P50 event-related potential was studied in abstinent chronic alcoholics to determine whether they had normal sensory gating. Repeated tones were presented to 17 recently detoxified chronic alcoholic patients and 17 healthy subjects while EEG was recorded. Low-resolution tomography (LORETA) was performed to obtain cerebral sources of P50. Abstinent chronic alcoholics showed reduced P50 sensory gating. Present results suggest an inhibitory deficit in early pre-attentive auditory sensory processing in chronic alcoholism. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Ma X, Guan X: Loreta-contracting algorithm for solving eeg source distribution problems. COMPEL - The International Journal for Computation and Mathematics in Electrical and Electronic Engineering 2005;24:821-828.<p>
Summary: Purpose - The electroencephalography (EEG) source tomography in bio-electromagnetics is to estimate current dipole sources inside the brain from the measured electric potential distribution on the scalp surface. A traditional algorithm is the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography algorithm (LORETA). In order to obtain high-resolution tomography, the LORETA-contracting algorithm is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - The relation between the dipolar current source J at the nodes in source region and the potential U at the observed points on the scalp surface can be expressed as a matrix equation U=KJ after discretization. K is a coefficient matrix. Usually its simultaneous equation is an under-determined system. The LORETA approach is to find out minBWJ2, under constraint U=KJ where B is the discrete Laplacian operator matrix, W is a weighting diagonal matrix. Its solution is J=(WB TBW)-1KT{K(WBTBW)-1K T}+U where {}+ denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix. The improvement on this approach is to establish an iterative program to repeat LORETA and reduce the number of unknown J quantities in the step i+1 by contracting the source region excluding some extreme little quantities of J given in the step i. The simultaneous equations will gradually turn to a properly determined system or to an over-determined system. Finally, its solution can be obtained by using the least square method. Findings - Repeating to make the low-resolution tomography by contracting the source region, we can get a high-resolution tomography easily. Research limitations/implications - The LORETA-contracting algorithm is based on the assumption that the dipolar current sources inside the brain are sparse and concentrated based on the physiological study of the brain activity. Originality/value - It is new to repeat LORETA combined with the contracting technique. This algorithm can be developed to solve EEG problems of realistic head models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.<p>

Summary: This paper presents a new algorithm called Standardized Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS (SSLOFO) for solving the electroencephalogram (EEG) inverse problem. Multiple techniques are combined in a single procedure to robustly reconstruct the underlying source distribution with high spatial resolution. This algorithm uses a recursive process which takes the smooth estimate of sLORETA as initialization and then employs the re-weighted minimum norm introduced by FOCUSS. An important technique called standardization is involved in the recursive process to enhance the localization ability. The algorithm is further improved by automatically adjusting the source space according to the estimate of the previous step, and by the inclusion of temporal information. Simulation studies are carried out on both spherical and realistic head models. The algorithm achieves very good localization ability on noise-free data. It is capable of recovering complex source configurations with arbitrary shapes and can produce high quality images of extended source distributions. We also characterized the performance with noisy data in a realistic head model. An important feature of this algorithm is that the temporal waveforms are clearly reconstructed, even for closely spaced sources. This provides a convenient way to estimate neural dynamics directly from the cortical sources. © 2005 IEEE.<p>

Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging 2005;138:141-156.<p>
Summary: In young, first-episode, productive, medication-naive patients with schizophrenia, EEG microstates (building blocks of mentation) tend to be shortened. Koenig et al. [Koenig, T., Lehmann, D., Merlo, M., Kochi, K., Hell, D., Koukkou, M., 1999. A deviant EEG brain microstate in acute, neuroleptic-nai?ve schizophrenics at rest. European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 249, 205-211] suggested that shortening concerned specific microstate classes. Sequence rules (microstate concatenations, syntax) conceivably might also be affected. In 27 patients of the above type and 27 controls, from three centers, multichannel resting EEG was analyzed into microstates using k-means clustering of momentary potential topographies into four microstate classes (A-D). In patients, microstates were shortened in classes B and D (from 80 to 70 ms and from 94 to 82 ms, respectively), occurred more frequently in classes A and C, and covered more time in A and less in B. Topography differed only in class B where LORETA tomography predominantly showed stronger left and anterior activity in patients. Microstate concatenation (syntax) generally were disturbed in patients; specifically, the class sequence A?C?D?A predominated in controls, but was reversed in patients (A?D?C?A). In schizophrenia, information processing in certain classes of mental operations might deviate because of precocious termination. The intermittent occurrence might account for Bleuler's &quot;double bookkeeping.&quot; The disturbed microstate syntax opens a novel physiological comparison of mental operations between patients and controls. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Laufer I, Pratt H: The 'f-complex' and mmn tap different aspects of deviance. Clinical Neurophysiology 2005;116:336-352.<p>
Summary: To compare the 'F(fusion)-complex' with the Mismatch negativity (MMN), both components associated with automatic detection of changes in the acoustic stimulus flow. Ten right-handed adult native Hebrew speakers discriminated vowel-consonant-vowel (V-C-V) sequences /ada/ (deviant) and /aga/ (standard) in an active auditory 'Oddball' task, and the brain potentials associated with performance of the task were recorded from 21 electrodes. Stimuli were generated by fusing the acoustic elements of the V-C-V sequences as follows: base was always presented in front of the subject, and formant transitions were presented to the front, left or right in a virtual reality room. An illusion of a lateralized echo (duplex sensation) accompanied base fusion with the lateralized formant locations. Source current density estimates were derived for the net response to the fusion of the speech elements (F-complex) and for the MMN, using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Statistical non-parametric mapping was used to estimate the current density differences between the brain sources of the F-complex and the MMN. Occipito-parietal regions and prefrontal regions were associated with the F-complex in all formant locations, whereas the vicinity of the supratemporal plane was bilaterally associated with the MMN, but only in case of front-fusion (no duplex effect). MMN is sensitive to the novelty of the auditory object in relation to other stimuli in a sequence, whereas the F-complex is sensitive to the acoustic features of the auditory object and reflects a process of matching them with target categories. The F-complex and MMN reflect different aspects of auditory processing in a stimulus-rich and changing environment: content analysis of the stimulus and novelty detection, respectively. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Using slow-cortical potentials (SCPs), Vitouch et al. (International Journal of Psychophysiology 27 (1997) 183-199) demonstrated that subjects with low ability to solve a complex visuo-spatial imagery task show higher activity in occipital, parietal and frontal cortex during task processing than subjects with high ability. This finding has been interpreted in the sense of the so-called &quot;neural efficiency&quot; hypothesis, which assumes that the central nervous system of individuals with higher intellectual abilities is functioning in a more efficient way than the one of individuals with lower abilities. Using a higher spatial resolution of SCP recordings, and by employing the source localization method of LORETA (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography), we investigated this hypothesis by performing an extended replication of Vitouch et al.'s study. SCPs during processing of a visuo-spatial imagery task were recorded in pre-selected subjects with either high or low abilities in solving the imagery task. Topographic and LORETA analyses of SCPs revealed that a distributed network of extrastriate occipital, superior parietal, temporal, medial frontal and prefrontal areas was active during task solving. This network is well in line with former studies of the functional neuroanatomy of visuo-spatial imagery. Contrary to our expectations, however, the results of Vitouch et al. as well as of other studies supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis could not be confirmed since no difference in brain activity between groups was observed. This inconsistency between studies might be due to differing task processing strategies. While subjects with high abilities in the Vitouch et al. study seemed to use a visuo-perceptual task solving approach, all other subjects relied upon a visuo-motor task processing strategy. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: The present study aims to accurately estimate the in vivo brain-to-skull conductivity ratio by means of cortical imaging technique. Simultaneous extra- and intra-cranial potential recordings induced by subdural current stimulation were analyzed to get the estimation. The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio was estimated in vivo for 5 epilepsy patients. The estimation was performed using multi-channel simultaneously recorded scalp and cortical electrical potentials during subdural electrical stimulation. The cortical imaging technique was used to compute the inverse cortical potential distribution from the scalp recorded potentials using a 3-shell head volume conductor model. The brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which leads to the most consistent cortical potential estimates with respect to the direct intra-cranial measurements, is considered to be the effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio. The present estimation provided consistent results in 5 human subjects studied. The in vivo effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio ranged from 18 to 34 in the 5 epilepsy patients. The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio can be estimated from simultaneous intra- and extra-cranial potential recordings and the averaged value/standard deviation is 25±7. The present results provide important experimental data on the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which is of significance for accurate brain source localization using piece-wise homogeneous head models. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Postconcussion syndrome (PCS) refers to symptoms and signs commonly occurring after mild head injury. The pathogenesis of PCS is unknown. The authors quantitatively analyzed EEG recordings, localized brain sources for abnormal activity, and correlated it with imaging studies. Data from 17 patients with neurologic symptomatology consistent with ICD-10 criteria for PCS was analyzed. Normalized quantitative EEG (QEEG) revealed significantly higher power in the delta band and lower power in the alpha band compared with matched controls. The generators for the abnormal rhythms were focally localized in neocortical regions. Brain computerized tomography and/or MRI did not reveal focal abnormality at the time of diagnosis. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer administration showed a focal reduction in perfusion in 85% (n = 11) of the patients, and abnormal blood-brain barrier (BBB) after 99mTc- diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid administration in 73% (n = 8). In 75% of these patients, low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analysis showed that the generators for abnormal rhythms were closely related to the anatomic location of the BBB lesion. These data point to focal cortical dysfunction in conjunction with BBB disruption and hypoperfusion as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in at least some PCS patients, and offer QEEG and SPECT as important tools in evaluating these patients.<p>

Summary: The authors discuss the clinical usefulness of individualized PET SPM analysis in the detection of pathophysiological correlates of psychopathology and in localizing the target for rTMS therapy. The article presents case studies about patients with musical hallucinations and OCD, organic schizoform disorder in temporal lobe epilepsy and depersonalization and derealization syndrome. Individualized PET SPM analysis could be a useful tool in psychiatry but it is not available for general psychiatric practice. LORETA, which uses an EEG machine is inexpensive, generally available and our preliminary clinical experience suggest that it could be sensitive to changes following TMS and can show at least partially similar abnormalities as revealed in 18FDG PET.<p>

Summary: Recently, we described a Bayesian inference approach to the MEG/EEG inverse problem that used numerical techniques to estimate the full posterior probability distributions of likely solutions upon which all inferences were based [Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Wood, C.C., 1999. Bayesian inference applied to the electromagnetic inverse problem. Human Brain Mapping 7, 195; Schmidt, D.M., George, J.S., Ranken, D.M., Wood, C.C., 2001. Spatial-temporal bayesian inference for MEG/EEG. In: Nenonen, J., Ilmoniemi, R. J., Katila, T. (Eds.), Biomag 2000: 12th International Conference on Biomagnetism. Espoo, Norway, p. 671]. Schmidt et al. (1999) focused on the analysis of data at a single point in time employing an extended region source model. They subsequently extended their work to a spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis of the full spatiotemporal MEG/EEG data set. Here, we formulate spatiotemporal Bayesian inference analysis using a multi-dipole model of neural activity. This approach is faster than the extended region model, does not require use of the subject's anatomical information, does not require prior determination of the number of dipoles, and yields quantitative probabilistic inferences. In addition, we have incorporated the ability to handle much more complex and realistic estimates of the background noise, which may be represented as a sum of Kronecker products of temporal and spatial noise covariance components. This reduces the effects of undermodeling noise. In order to reduce the rigidity of the multi-dipole formulation which commonly causes problems due to multiple local minima, we treat the given covariance of the background as uncertain and marginalize over it in the analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to sample the many possible likely solutions. The spatiotemporal Bayesian dipole analysis is demonstrated using simulated and empirical whole-head MEG data. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Jokisch D, Daum I, Suchan B, Troje NF: Structural encoding and recognition of biological motion: Evidence from event-related potentials and source analysis. Behavioural Brain Research 2005;157:195-204.<p>
Summary: In the present study, we investigated how different processing stages involved in the perceptual analysis of biological motion (BM) are reflected by modulations in event-related potentials (ERP) in order to elucidate the time course and location of neural processing of BM. Data analysis was carried out using conventional averaging techniques as well as source localization with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). ERPs were recorded in response to point-light displays of a walking person, an inverted walking person and displays of scrambled motion. Analysis yielded a pronounced negativity with a peak at 180 ms after stimulus onset which was more pronounced for upright walkers than for inverted walkers and scrambled motion. A later negative component between 230 and 360 ms after stimulus onset had a larger amplitude for upright and inverted walkers as compared to scrambled walkers. In the later component, negativity was more pronounced in the right hemisphere revealing asymmetries in BM perception. LORETA analysis yielded evidence for sources specific to BM within the right fusiform gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus for the second component, whereas sources for BM in the early component were located in areas associated with attentional aspects of visual processing. The early component might reflect the pop-out effect of a moving dot pattern representing the highly familiar form of a human figure, whereas the later component might be associated with the specific analysis of motion patterns providing biologically relevant information. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on schizophrenic negative symptoms (NS) and EEG topography were investigated in this pilot study. 10 patients with predominant NS were treated with 10 Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 5 days. For NS ratings, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) was used. Both ratings and EEG recordings were obtained pre- and post-rTMS. Electrical activity changes were computed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography. SANS showed an improvement after rTMS, from 49.0 (SD: 10.7) to 44.7 (SD: 11.8) (means). EEG frequency bands were changed fronto-temporally (right) and were mainly decreases in delta- and beta- and increases in alpha1-activity, as well as decreases in beta-activity in the temporal and parieto-occipital regions (left). Although we are aware of the limitations of this study, we assume a slight improvement in NS. The EEG findings refer to a possible neurophysiologic correlate of their improvement after rTMS. © Springer-Verlag 2004.<p>

Summary: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing results of magnetoencephalography cortical source imaging. The proposed approach utilizes bell-shaped functions defined on an inflated cortical surface, which has one-to-one correspondence with original tessel-lated cortical surface. The coefficients of the functions are then determined using sensitivity analysis with conjugate gradient updating scheme. Applications of the approach to a simulation study and a practical experiment have resulted in more stable and smoother brain source distribution, compared to conventional linear inverse approach. © 2005 IEEE.<p>

Summary: An evolutionary dipole model is constructed describing the spatio-temporal behavior of the electric potential on the surface of the head (EEG data). An approach is proposed to the solution of the direct three-dimensional EEG problem (finding the induced field). This approach finds the solution as a semi-analytical representation of an approximate solution in spherical functions with indeterminate coefficients. The coefficients are then determined by least squares. The method works with arbitrary (nonspherical) boundary surfaces, unbounded regions, finite conductivity outside the head, and complex spatial dependence of electrical conductivity. A nonhomogeneous conductivity model is considered with conductivity varying sharply across layers. An accurate numerical solution can be obtained if the conductivity of the layers differs by a factor of 80, which ensures sufficient accuracy in estimating dipole localization. Optimal dipole placement is reconstructed by a genetic algorithm, which also determines the best combination and the best number of dipoles. The method works also when several brain zones are active simultaneously. During the iterative fitting of the dipole parameters to minimize the error functional, the evolution of the genetic algorithm is directly linked with the temporal variation of the EEG signal. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.<p>

Summary: We discuss the application of beamforming techniques to the field of magnetoencephalography (MEG). We argue that beamformers have given us an insight into the dynamics of oscillatory changes across the cortex not explored previously with traditional analysis techniques that rely on averaged evoked responses. We review several experiments that have used beamformers, with special emphasis on those in which the results have been compared to those observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and on those studying induced phenomena. We suggest that the success of the beamformer technique, despite the assumption that there are no linear interactions between the mesoscopic local field potentials across distinct cortical areas, may tell us something of the balance between functional integration and segregation in the human brain. What is more, MEG beamformer analysis facilitates the study of these complex interactions within cortical networks that are involved in both sensory-motor and cognitive processes. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Herrmann MJ, Ehlis AC, Muehlberger A, Fallgatter AJ: Source localization of early stages of face processing. Brain Topography 2005;18:77-85.<p>
Summary: Recent studies using ERPs in face recognition revealed that face processing starts around 100 ms after stimulus onset, 70 ms earlier than suggested before. While the neural sources of the N170 component have repeatedly been found to be localized in the gyrus fusiformis and the inferior occipital cortex, sources have not yet been investigated for the P100 component during face processing. Therefore, we measured the ERPs elicited by faces and control stimuli in 72 subjects in order to localize the neural sources of both the P100 and the N170 component. We observed significantly higher P100 and N170 amplitudes to faces compared to control stimuli. LORETA source localization revealed significantly higher brain activity in the left and right gyrus fusiformis for the N170 component, with additional regions of increased brain activation in a parieto-temporal-occipital network. For the P100, faces activated the left and right gyrus fusiformis significantly stronger than control stimuli. This study reveals that the first step of face processing (about 100 ms after stimulus presentation) is localized in the gyrus fusiformis. The second step of face processing around 170 ms involves the gyrus fusiformis, with additional activation in a more distributed network, including the occipital cortex.

Summary: Linear estimators have been used widely in the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem, but their properties and relationships have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that the most widely used linear estimators may be characterized by a choice of norms on signal space and on source space. These norms depend, in part, on assumptions about the signal space and source space covariances. We demonstrate that two estimator classes (standardized and weight vector normalized) yield unbiased estimators of source location for simple source models (including only the noise-free case) but biased estimators of source magnitude. In the presence of instrumental (white) noise, we show that the nonadaptive standardized estimator is a biased estimator of source location, while the adaptive weight vector normalized estimator remains unbiased. A third class (distortionless) is an unbiased estimator of source magnitude but a biased estimatof of source location. © 2005 IEEE.<p>

<li>Fu S, Greenwood PM, Parasuraman R: Brain mechanisms of involuntary visuospatial attention: An event-related potential study. Human Brain Mapping 2005;25:378-390.<p>
Summary: The brain mechanisms mediating visuospatial attention were investigated by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during a line-orientation discrimination task. Nonpredictive peripheral cues were used to direct participant's attention involuntarily to a spatial location. The earliest attentional modulation was observed in the P1 component (peak latency about 130 ms), with the valid trials eliciting larger P1 than invalid trials. Moreover, the attentional modulations on both the amplitude and latency of the P1 and N1 components had a different pattern as compared to previous studies with voluntary attention tasks. In contrast, the earliest visual ERP component, C1 (peak latency about 80 ms), was not modulated by attention. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed that the earliest attentional modulation occurred in extrastriate cortex (middle occipital gyrus, BA 19) but not in the primary visual cortex. Later attention-related reactivations in the primary visual cortex were found at about 110 ms after stimulus onset. The results suggest that involuntary as well as voluntary attention modulates visual processing at the level of extrastriate cortex; however, at least some different processes are involved by involuntary attention compared to voluntary attention. In addition, the possible feedback from higher visual cortex to the primary visual cortex is faster and occurs earlier in involuntary relative to voluntary attention task. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Fu S, Caggiano DM, Greenwood PM, Parasuraman R: Event-related potentials reveal dissociable mechanisms for orienting and focusing visuospatial attention. Cognitive Brain Research 2005;23:341-353.<p>
Summary: The neural mechanisms supporting visuospatial orienting and focusing were investigated by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in a cued, line-orientation discrimination task. Search arrays flashed randomly in the left or right visual field and were preceded by peripheral cues that varied in validity (valid or invalid, with 50% each) and size (large or small, with 50% each). Facilitation of response time was observed for valid trials, regardless of cue size. In contrast to previous cued search studies, however, small (i.e., more precise) cues were associated with delayed responses. Both the timing and the amplitudes of the early ERP components, P1 and N1, were modulated by attentional orienting, with valid trials eliciting a larger and later contralateral vP1 (ventral P1) and a smaller and later contralateral N1 compared to invalid trials. Attentional focusing modulated only the amplitudes of the P1 component, with precisely cued trials eliciting a larger dP1 (dorsal P1) than less precisely cued trials at both contralateral and ipsilateral sites. Thus, both attentional orienting and focusing modulate early stimulus processing stages that overlap in time, but with dissociable effects on the scalp distribution of these components, indicating possibly different underlying mechanisms. In addition, the results support the notion that voluntary and involuntary allocations of visuospatial attention are mediated by different underlying neural processes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Objective: To study the dynamics of spatial synchronization of the slow-wave activity recorded from different scalp electrodes during sleep in healthy normal controls. Methods: We characterized the different levels of EEG synchronization during sleep (in the 0.25-2.5 Hz band) of five healthy subjects by means of the synchronization likelihood (SL) algorithm and analyzed its long-range temporal correlations by means of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Results: We found higher levels of interregional synchronization during 'cyclic alternating pattern' (CAP) sleep than during nonCAP with a small but significant difference between its A and B phases. SL during CAP showed fluctuations probably corresponding to the single EEG slow-wave elements. DFA showed the presence of two linear scaling regions in the double-logarithmic plot of the fluctuations of SL level as a function of time scale. This indicates the presence of a characteristic time scale in the underlying dynamics which was very stable among the different subjects (1.23-1.33 s). We also computed the DFA exponent of the two scaling regions; the first, with values ?1.5, corresponded to fluctuations with period 0.09-0.75 s and the second, with values ?1, corresponded to fluctuations with period 1.5-24.0 s. Only the first exponent showed different values during the different sleep stages. Conclusions: All these results indicate a different role for each sleep stage and CAP condition in the EEG synchronization processes of sleep which show a complex time structure correlated with its neurophysiological mechanisms. Significance: Very slow oscillations in spatial EEG synchronization might play a critical role in the long-range temporal EEG correlations during sleep which might be the chain of events responsible for the maintenance and correct complex development of sleep structure during the night. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Ferri R, Bruni O, Miano S, Terzano MG: Topographic mapping of the spectral components of the cyclic alternating pattern (cap). Sleep Medicine 2005;6:29-36.<p>
Summary: Background and purpose: The aim of this study was to define quantitatively the spectrum content of the sleep pattern termed 'cyclic alternating pattern' (CAP) A phases, their scalp topography and their probable cortical generators, by using data from sleep polygraphic recordings that included a large number of scalp EEG channels. Patients and methods: Polysomnographic recording that include 19 EEG channels were obtained from 5 normal healthy young controls. After sleep staging, for each subject, 5 different CAP A phase subtype epochs were selected, which served for subsequent analysis. Following the analysis of power spectra calculated on the C4 channel by means of the fast Fourier transform, two different frequency bands were detected: 0.25-2.5 and 7-12 Hz, representing the frequency peak in the profiles of the different CAP subtypes. All the subsequent analyses were performed on these two bands. Scalp topographic color mapping was carried out using the data from all the 19 EEG channels recorded, and by means of the 4-nearest neighbor algorithm. Individual average maps were obtained for both frequency bands. Finally, we used the low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) functional imaging for the source analysis of the two EEG frequency components of CAP A phases. Results: The quantitative spectral analysis of the different A phase subtypes shows the existence of two distinct spectral components characterizing CAP subtypes A1 (0.25-2.5 Hz) and A3 (7-12 Hz). These two components coexist in CAP A2 subtypes. The topography of these two components shows a clear prevalence over the anterior frontal regions for the 0.25-2.5 Hz band and over the parietal-occipital areas for the 7-12 Hz band. Finally, the generators of the low-frequency component of CAP seemed to be localized mostly over the frontal midline cortex; on the contrary, those of the high-frequency band involved both midline and hemispheric areas within the parietal and occipital areas. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the presence of two fundamentally distinct frequency bands which are expressed individually (A1 and A3) or in association (A2) in the different CAP A phase subtypes. The analysis of scalp distribution maps indicates that the two frequency components recognized are distributed over clearly different areas of the scalp. Moreover, the LORETA analysis indicates that also the probable cortical generators of these two frequency bands are different and well separated and distinct. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Objective: To analyze in detail the frequency content of the different EEG components of the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP), taking into account the ongoing EEG background and the nonCAP (NCAP) periods in the whole night polysomnographic recordings of normal young adults. Methods: Sixteen normal healthy subjects were included in this study. Each subject underwent one polysomnographic night recording; sleep stages were scored following standard criteria. Subsequently, each CAP A phase was detected in all recordings, during NREM sleep, and classified into 3 subtypes (A1, A2, and A3). The same channel used for the detection of CAP A phases (C3/A2 or C4/A1) was subdivided into 2-s mini-epochs. For each mini-epoch, the corresponding CAP condition was determined and power spectra calculated in the frequency range 0.5-25 Hz. Average spectra were obtained for each CAP condition, separately in sleep stage 2 and SWS, for each subject. Finally, the first 6 h of sleep were subdivided into 4 periods of 90 min each and the same spectral analysis was performed for each period. Results: During sleep stage 2, CAP A subtypes differed from NCAP periods for all frequency bins between 0.5 and 25 Hz; this difference was most evident for the lowest frequencies. The B phase following A1 subtypes had a power spectrum significantly higher than that of NCAP, for frequencies between 1 and 11 Hz. The B phase after A2 only differed from NCAP for a small but significant reduction in the sigma band power; this was evident also after A3 subtypes. During SWS, we found similar results. The comparison between the different CAP subtypes also disclosed significant differences related to the stage in which they occurred. Finally, a significant effect of the different sleep periods was found on the different CAP subtypes during sleep stage 2 and on NCAP in both sleep stage 2 and SWS. Conclusions: CAP subtypes are characterized by clearly different spectra and also the same subtype shows a different power spectrum, during sleep stage 2 or SWS. This finding underlines a probable different functional meaning of the same CAP subtype during different sleep stages. We also found 3 clear peaks of difference between CAP subtypes and NCAP in the delta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges which might indicate the presence of 3 frequency components characterizing CAP subtypes, in different proportion in each of them. The B component of CAP differs from NCAP because of a decrease in power in the sigma frequency range. Significance: This study shows that A components of CAP might correspond to periods in which the very-slow delta activity of sleep groups a range of different EEG activities, including the sigma and beta bands, while the B phase of CAP might correspond to a period in which this activity is quiescent or inhibited. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: The aim of the present study was to investigate prefrontal brain function and cognitive response control in patients with personality disorders who either suffered or did not suffer from psychopathology related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during childhood. For this purpose, 36 psychiatric out-patients with personality disorders-24 of whom showed ADHD-related psychopathology during childhood assessed by the German short form of the Wender Utah Rating Scale-and 24 healthy controls were investigated electrophysiologically by means of a cued Go-NoGo task (Continuous Performance Test). Topographical analyses were conducted to individually quantify the NoGo anteriorisation (NGA), a neurophysiological correlate of prefrontal response control that has been suggested to reflect activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. ADHD patients exhibited a significantly reduced mean NGA and diminished amplitudes of the Global Field Power, as well as a reduced increase of fronto-central P300 amplitudes, in NoGo-trials compared with the healthy controls, whereas patients with personality disorders alone did not differ from the control group in any of the electrophysiological parameters. The results indicate that ADHD-related psychopathology is associated with prefrontal brain dysfunction, probably related to processes of response inhibition and/or cognitive response control. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Prefrontal structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play a decisive role in processes of action monitoring and response control, functions often impaired in schizophrenia. Patients with cycloid psychoses exhibit some characteristic neurophysiological features not indicative of the cerebral hypofrontality observed in schizophrenia. This study aimed at examining if cycloid psychoses-unlike schizophrenias-involve a normal brain-electrical topography during a task demanding prefrontal response control. Thirty-seven patients with cycloid psychoses and 37 healthy controls were investigated electrophysiologically while performing a Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Topographical analyses were conducted to individually quantify the Nogo-anteriorisation (NGA) as a neurophysiological index of prefrontal response control. The patients exhibited an unaltered topography with a mean NGA not significantly different from the controls. They did, however, differ from the control group regarding their Global Field Power (GFP), with a significantly reduced GFP (p&lt;0.001) and decreased latencies (p&lt;0.01) during Nogo trials. On a behavioral level, patients exhibited prolonged reaction times and an increased rate of omission errors. The investigated patients showed an activation of specific (presumably frontal) brain areas during Nogo trials, resulting in a frontalisation of the brain-electrical field comparable to the control group. However, the strength of this activation was apparently reduced. The patients' unaltered topographical pattern contrasts with previous findings in schizophrenic patients and supports the hypothesis that cycloid psychoses entail less severe prefrontal deficits than schizophrenias, which might be an indication of different biological backgrounds for both groups of endogenous psychoses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: Disturbance of prefrontal brain functions is assumed to be responsible for prominent psychopathological symptoms in psychotic disorders. Treatment with atypical, in contrast to typical antipsychotics is considered as a possible strategy for an improvement of prefrontal brain function. In the present study, response control as a specific prefrontal brain function was assessed by means of the Nogo-anteriorization (NGA) derived from the event-related potentials elicited during a Go-NoGo task in a consecutive sample of 39 patients suffering from acute psychotic disorders (brief psychotic disorders, 298.8, n = 34 and schizoaffective disorders, 295.70,n = 5; cycloid psychoses according to the Leonhard classification). A highly significant positive correlation between the amount of antipsychotic medication in terms of chlorpromazine equivalents per day and the NGA as a measure of prefrontal response control was only found in the subgroup of patients treated exclusively or predominantly with atypical antipsychotics but not for those treated with typical antipsychotics. These results are in line with the notion that atypical antipsychotics may exert a beneficial effect on prefrontal brain function.<p>

<li>Durka PJ, Matysiak A, Montes EM, Sosa PV, Blinowska KJ: Multichannel matching pursuit and eeg inverse solutions. Journal of Neuroscience Methods 2005;148:49-59.<p>
Summary: We present a new approach to the preprocessing of the electroencephalographic time series for EEG inverse solutions. As the first step, EEG recordings are decomposed by multichannel matching pursuit algorithm - in this study we introduce a computationally efficient, suboptimal solution. Then, based upon the parameters of the waveforms fitted to the EEG (frequency, amplitude and duration), we choose those corresponding to the the phenomena of interest, like e.g. sleep spindles. For each structure, the corresponding weights of each channel define a topographic signature, which can be subject to an inverse solution procedure, like e.g. Loreta, used in this work. As an example, we present an automatic detection and parameterization of sleep spindles, appearing in overnight polysomnographic recordings. Inverse solutions obtained for single sleep spindles are coherent with the averages obtained for 20 overnight EEG recordings analyzed in this study, as well as with the results reported previously in literature as inter-subject averages of solutions for spectral integrals, computed on visually selected spindles. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<li>Ding L, Lai Y, He B: Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography in a realistic geometry head model: A simulation study. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2005;50:45-56.<p>
Summary: It is of importance to localize neural sources from scalp recorded EEG. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has received considerable attention for localizing brain electrical sources. However, most such efforts have used spherical head models in representing the head volume conductor. Investigation of the performance of LORETA in a realistic geometry head model, as compared with the spherical model, will provide useful information guiding interpretation of data obtained by using the spherical head model. The performance of LORETA was evaluated by means of computer simulations. The boundary element method was used to solve the forward problem. A three-shell realistic geometry (RG) head model was constructed from MRI scans of a human subject. Dipole source configurations of a single dipole located at different regions of the brain with varying depth were used to assess the performance of LORETA in different regions of the brain. A three-sphere head model was also used to approximate the RG head model, and similar simulations performed, and results compared with the RG-LORETA with reference to the locations of the simulated sources. Multisource localizations were discussed and examples given in the RG head model. Localization errors employing the spherical LORETA, with reference to the source locations within the realistic geometry head, were about 20-30 mm, for four brain regions evaluated: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Localization effors employing the RG head model were about 10 mm over the same four brain regions. The present simulation results suggest that the use of the RG head model reduces the localization error of LORETA, and that the RG head model based LORETA is desirable if high localization accuracy is needed. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.<p>

Summary: Objective: To verify findings of an independently regulated anterior limbic alpha band source. Methods: In a randomised cross-over study, the spontaneous EEG was recorded in nine healthy subjects after i.v. lorazepam or placebo. Intracerebral current densities within classical frequency bands were estimated with low resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA] and compared between groups with t-statistical parametric mapping [SPM{t}]. A region-of-interest [ROI] based method was used to compare frontal and occipital alpha band activity changes. Results: Irrespective of treatment group, local maxima of alpha band power were localised both in the occipital lobe, Brodman area [BA] 18, and in the anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], BA 32. Statistical parametric mapping showed reduced parieto-occipital, but unaltered frontal alpha band power after lorazepam. This result was confirmed by ROI-based comparison of BA 18 and BA 32. Conclusions: There was an anterior limbic maximum of alpha band activity which, unlike occipital alpha, was not suppressed by lorazepam. Significance: The well-known anterior alpha band components may originate from a narrowly circumscribed source, located in the ACC. Frontal and occipital alpha band activities appear to be independently regulated. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Carretie L, Hinojosa JA, Mercado F, Tapia M: Cortical response to subjectively unconscious danger. NeuroImage 2005;24:615-623.<p>
Summary: Cortical involvement in the evolution-favored automatic reaction to danger was studied. Electrical neural activity was recorded from 31 subjects, reporting fear of spiders, at 60 scalp locations. Visual stimuli containing spiders (negative elements) or, alternatively, nonnegative elements were presented to subjects, though they were unaware of their presence: a concurrent visual detection task using consciously perceived targets was administered. Spatial and temporal principal component analyses were employed to define and quantify, in a reliable manner, the main components of the neuroelectrical response to unconscious stimuli, and a source localization algorithm provided information on their neural origin. Results indicated that around 150 ms after stimulus onset, ventromedial prefrontal areas previously reported as responding rapidly to danger-related (conscious) stimuli were activated by unconsciously perceived spiders more markedly than by nonnegative unconscious stimuli. Subsequently, around 500 ms after stimulus onset, activation of the posterior cingulate and visual association cortices increased in this same direction. These data support previous results indicating that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved in the top-down regulation of attention (through its capability to modulate the activity of posterior cortices in charge of visual processing) and that it automatically facilitates danger processing. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: This paper highlights the ways in which Internet data-bases may be efficiently used to foster the application of progress in biomedical sciences via data sharing and new algorithms. Employing the Internet to accelerate the pace of interdisciplinary research has significant potential, yet as with all new technologies, the first applications often cause more disappointment than positive outcomes. We discuss examples of solutions to the basic issues: (1) finding the relevant datasets (in portals connected via the Inter-neuro infrastructure), (2) reading the particular format in which the data was stored (using the SignalML language for metadescription of time series), (3) choosing the right method for the data analysis (we provide a brief review of the methods used for the analysis of EEGs, and discuss two of them in detail: Directed Transfer Function and Matching Pursuit), and (4) sharing the software for chosen methods of analysis (via repositories such as the eeg.pl thematic portal).<p>

<li>Bellebaum C, Hoffmann KP, Daum I: Post-saccadic updating of visual space in the posterior parietal cortex in humans. Behavioural Brain Research 2005;163:194-203.<p>
Summary: Updating of visual space takes place in the posterior parietal cortex to guarantee spatial constancy across eye movements. However, the timing of updating with respect to saccadic eye movements remains a matter of debate. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 15 volunteers during a saccadic double-step task to elucidate the time course of the updating process. In the experimental condition updating of visual space was required, because both saccade targets had already disappeared before the first saccade was executed. A similar task without updating requirements served as control condition. ERP analysis revealed a significantly larger slow positive wave in the retino-spatial dissonance condition compared to the control condition, starting between 150 and 200 ms after first saccade onset. Source analysis showed an asymmetry with respect to the direction of the first saccade. Whereas the source was restricted to the right PPC in trials with leftward first saccades, left and right PPC were involved in rightward trials. The results of the present study suggest that updating of visual space in a saccadic double-step task occurs not earlier than 150 ms after the onset of the first saccade. We conclude that extraretinal information about the first saccade is integrated with motor information about the second saccade in the inter-saccade interval. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: We present a method that estimates three-dimensional statistical maps for electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization. The maps assess the likelihood that a point in the brain contains a dipolar source, under the hypothesis of one, two or three activated sources. This is achieved by examining all combinations of one to three dipoles on a coarse grid and attributing to each combination a score based on an F statistic. The probability density function of the statistic under the null hypothesis is estimated nonparametrically, using bootstrap resampling. A theoretical F distribution is then fitted to the empirical distribution in order to allow correction for multiple comparisons. The maps allow for the systematic exploration of the solution space for dipolar sources. They permit to test whether the data support a given solution. They do not rely on the assumption of uncorrelated source time courses. They can be compared to other statistical parametric maps such as those used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results are presented for both simulated and real data. The maps were compared with LORETA and MUSIC results. For the real data consisting of an average of epileptic spikes, we observed good agreement between the EEG statistical maps, intracranial EEG recordings, and fMRI activations. © 2005 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Three participants with callosal agenesis and 12 neurologically normal participants were tested on a simple reaction time task, with visual evoked potentials collected using a high-density 128-channel system. Independent-components analyses were performed on the averaged visual evoked potentials to isolate the components of interest. Contrary to previous research with acallosals, evidence of ipsilateral activation was present in all 3 participants. Although ipsilateral visual components were present in all 4 unilateral conditions in the 2 related acallosal participants, in the 3rd, these were present only in the crossed visual field-hand conditions and not in the uncrossed conditions. Suggestions are made as to why these results differ from earlier findings and as to the neural mechanisms facilitating this ipsilateral activation.

<li>Bai X, He B: On the estimation of the number of dipole sources in eeg source localization. Clinical Neurophysiology 2005;116:2037-2043.<p>
Summary: Objective: The purpose of the present study was to determine the number of the equivalent dipole sources corresponding to the scalp EEG using the information criterion method based on the instantaneous-state modeling. Methods: A three-concentric-spheres head model was used to represent the head volume conductor. The Powell algorithm was used to solve the inverse problem of estimating the equivalent dipoles from the scalp EEG. The information criterion with different penalty functions was used to determine the dipole number. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate effects of various parameters on the estimation of dipole number. Results: The present results suggest that the present method is able to estimate the number of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) from instantaneous scalp EEG measurements, and that increase in the electrode number can improve the accuracy of estimation of the ECD number. For two ECDs, the best performance of estimation with 20% white noise were 85%, 92% and 94%, when 64, 128 and 256 electrodes are used, respectively. When there are 3 ECDs, the present results suggest that using 256 electrodes gave up to 82% estimation accuracy. The present simulation results also indicate that the accuracies of identification are similar when the minimum distance between dipoles is either 1 or 2 cm, which was used in the simulation. It was also found that the different penalty functions used in the information criterion method could have substantial influence on the estimation accuracy. Conclusions: The present method can estimate the number of ECDs from instantaneous scalp EEG distribution for up to three dipoles. Significance: The successful estimation of the number of ECDs will play an important role in expanding the applicability of dipole source localization to multiple sources. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Background. When the physiological activity of the brain (e.g., electroencephalogram, functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc.) is monitored in real-time, feedback can be returned to the subject and he/she can try to exercise some control over it. This idea is at the base of research on neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces. Current advances in the speed of microprocessors, graphics cards and digital signal processing algorithms allow significant improvements in these methods. More meaningful features from the continuous flow of brain activation can be extracted and feedback can be more informative. Methods. Borrowing technology so far employed only in virtual reality, we have created Open-ViBE (Open Platform for Virtual Brain Environments). Open-ViBE is a general purpose platform for the development of three dimensional real-time virtual representations of brain physiological and anatomical data. Open-ViBE is a flexible and modular platform that integrates modules for brain physiological data acquisition, processing, and volumetric rendering. Results. When input data is the electroencephalogram, Open-ViBE uses the estimation of intra-cranial current density to represent brain activation as a regular grid of three dimensional graphical objects. The color and size of these objects co-vary with the amplitude and/or direction of the electrical current. This representation can be superimposed onto a volumetric rendering of the subject's MRI data to form the anatomical background of the scene. The user can navigate in this virtual brain and visualize it as a whole or only some of its parts. This allows the user to experience the sense of presence (being there) in the scene and to observe the dynamics of brain current activity in its original spatio-temporal relations. Conclusions. The platform is based on publicly available frameworks such as OpenMASK and OpenSG and is open source itself. In this way we aim to enhance the cooperation of researchers and to promote the use of the platform on a large scale. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: A new electroencephalogram (EEG) source reconstruction method is presented. The method reduces the number of unknown quantities of the basic EEG equation by contracting the source region iteratively. The simultaneous equation system turns from an underdetermined system to an overdetermined system step by step. At last the least square algorithm is used to get a unique solution. The simulation shows that a high-resolution result can be obtained by using the method proposed.<p>

Summary: A finite element algorithm has been developed to solve the electroencephalogram (EEG) forward problem. A new computationally efficient approach to calculate the stiffness matrix of second-order tetrahedral elements has been developed for second-order tetrahedral finite element models. The present algorithm has been evaluated by means of computer simulations, by comparing with analytic solutions in a multi-spheres concentric head model. The developed finite element method (FEM) algorithm has also been applied to address questions of interest in the EEG forward problem. The present simulation study indicates that the second-order FEM provides substantially enhanced numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, as compared with the first-order FEM for comparable numbers of tetrahedral elements. The anisotropic conductivity distribution of the head tissue can be taken into account in the present FEM algorithm. The effects of dipole eccentricity, size of finite elements and local mesh refinement on solution accuracy are also addressed in the present simulation study. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.<p>

Summary: In the dynamical inverse problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) generation where a specific dynamics for the electrical current distribution is assumed, we can impose general spatiotemporal constraints onto the solution by casting the problem into a state space representation and assuming a specific class of parametric models for the dynamics. The Akaike Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), which is based on the Type II likelihood, was used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the model. In addition, dynamic low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new approach for estimating the current distribution is introduced. A recursive penalized least squares (RPLS) step forms the main element of our implementation. To obtain improved inverse solutions, dynamic LORETA exploits both spatial and temporal information, whereas LORETA uses only spatial information. A considerable improvement in performance compared to LORETA was found when dynamic LORETA was applied to simulated EEG data, and the new method was applied also to clinical EEG data. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Xu XL, Xu B, He B: An alternative substance approach to eeg dipole source localization. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2004;49:327-343.<p>
Summary: In the present study, we investigate a new approach to electroencephalography (EEG) three-dimensional (3D) dipole source localization by using a non-recursive subspace algorithm called FINES. In estimating source dipole locations, the present approach employs projections onto a subspace spanned by a small set of particular vectors (FINES vector set) in the estimated noise-only subspace instead of the entire estimated noise-only subspace in the case of classic MUSIC. The subspace spanned by this vector set is, in the sense of principal angle, closest to the subspace spanned by the array manifold associated with a particular brain region. By incorporating knowledge of the array manifold in identifying FINES vector sets in the estimated noise-only subspace for different brain regions, the present approach is able to estimate sources with enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution, thus enhancing the capability of resolving closely spaced sources and reducing estimation errors. The present computer simulations show, in EEG 3D dipole source localization, that compared to classic MUSIC, FINES has (1) better resolvability of two closely spaced dipolar sources and (2) better estimation accuracy of source locations. In comparison with RAP-MUSIC, FINES' performance is also better for the cases studied when the noise level is high and/or correlations among dipole sources exist.<p>

Summary: Objective: Dipole localization of grand-average event related potentials only give a tentative description of the estimated underlying neural sources. This study evaluates the differences in dipole solutions between individual and group-average data sets using a standard realistic head model. Methods: Auditory evoked potentials were recorded from 14 right-handed healthy subjects using a 64 electrode montage. Inverse dipole solutions were obtained for each individual data set, as well as for all individual responses averaged together (grand-average). Differences in dipole solutions between individual and grand-average responses are reported. Simulations using a two dipole model with 15 different electrode sets are then used to investigate the effects of electrode misplacement and random noise on dipole localization. These effects are compared to those due to grand-averaging. Results: The average differences in dipole locations between the individual and grand-averaged data sets were approximately 1.1 cm (SD=0.7 cm). This difference is larger than typical localization errors due to electrode misplacement and typical noise. Conclusions: Using a standard realistic head model, it is concluded that dipole solutions based on group-averaged EEG datasets are significantly different than those obtained using subject-specific data. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Wagner M, Fuchs M, Kastner J: Evaluation of sloreta in the presence of noise and multiple sources. Brain Topography 2004;16:277-280.<p>
Summary: The standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography method (sLORETA) can be used to compute statistical maps from EEG and MEG data that indicate the locations of the underlying source processes with low error. These maps are derived by performing a location-wise inverse weighting of the results of a Minimum Norm Least Squares (MNLS) analysis with their estimated variances. In this contribution, we evaluate the performance of the method under the presence of noise and with multiple, simultaneously active sources. It is shown that the sLORETA method localizes well, as compared to other linear approaches such as MNLS and LORETA. However, simultaneously active sources can only be separated if their fields are distinct enough and of similar strength. In the context of a strong or superficial source, weak or deep sources remain invisible, and nearby sources of similar orientation tend not to be separated but interpreted as one source located roughly in between.<p>

<li>Trujillo-Barreto NJ, Aubert-Va?zquez E, Valde?s-Sosa PA: Bayesian model averaging in eeg/meg imaging. NeuroImage 2004;21:1300-1319.<p>
Summary: In this paper, the Bayesian Theory is used to formulate the Inverse Problem (IP) of the EEG/MEG. This formulation offers a comparison framework for the wide range of inverse methods available and allows us to address the problem of model uncertainty that arises when dealing with different solutions for a single data. In this case, each model is defined by the set of assumptions of the inverse method used, as well as by the functional dependence between the data and the Primary Current Density (PCD) inside the brain. The key point is that the Bayesian Theory not only provides for posterior estimates of the parameters of interest (the PCD) for a given model, but also gives the possibility of finding posterior expected utilities unconditional on the models assumed. In the present work, this is achieved by considering a third level of inference that has been systematically omitted by previous Bayesian formulations of the IP. This level is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The new approach is illustrated in the case of considering different anatomical constraints for solving the IP of the EEG in the frequency domain. This methodology allows us to address two of the main problems that affect linear inverse solutions (LIS): (a) the existence of ghost sources and (b) the tendency to underestimate deep activity. Both simulated and real experimental data are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the BMA approach, and some of the results are compared with the solutions obtained using the popular low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and its anatomically constraint version (cLORETA). © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: In order to investigate the neuroanatomical chronometry of word processing, two experiments using: Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) have been performed. The first one was designed to test the effects of orthographic, phonologic, and lexical properties of linguistic items on the pre-semantic components of ERPs during a passive reading task and massive repetition used to reduce familiarity effect between words and nonwords. In a second study, the level of familiarity was investigated by varying stimulus repetition and frequency in a lexical decision task. Overall results suggest a functional discrimination between orthographic and nonorthographic stimuli begun as early as 170 ms (N170 component) whereas the next components (N230 and N320) were sensitive to the orthographic nature of the stimuli, but also to their lexical/phonologic proprieties. The N320 associated to phonological processing (Bentin et al, 1999) was modulated by word frequency and massive repetition caused its disappearance. This suggests that this component may reflect a nonobligatoty phonologic stage of grapheme-phoneme conversion postulated by the DRC model (Coltheart et al., 2001) or semantic phonologically mediated pathway (Harm &amp; Seidenberg, in press).<p>

Summary: Objective In this work we study the performance of minimum norm methods to estimate the localization of brain electrical activity. These methods are based on the simplest forms of L1 and L2 norm estimates and are applied to simulated EEG data. The influence of several factors like the number of electrodes, grid density, head model, the number and depth of the sources and noise levels was taken into account. The main objective of the study is to give information about the dependence, on these factors, of the localization sources, to allow for proper interpretation of the data obtained in real EEG records. Methods For the tests we used simulated dipoles and compared the localizations predicted by the L1 and L2 norms with the location of these point-like sources. We varied each parameter separately and evaluated the results. Results From this work we conclude that, the grid should be constructed with approximately 650 points, so that the information about the orientation of the sources is preserved, especially for L2 norm estimates; in favorable noise conditions, both L1 and L2 norm approaches are able to distinguish between more than one point-like sources. Conclusions The critical dependence of the results on the noise level and source depth indicates that regularized and weighted solutions should be used. Finally, all these results are valid both for spherical and for realistic head models. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Differences in cognitive processing between spatially possible and impossible figures were investigated using event-related potentials (ERPs). Two types of figures with identical luminance and equivalent spatial frequency were used as visual stimuli: possible three-dimensional figures (drawn with perspective and existing in the three-dimensional world) and impossible figures (drawn with perspective but not existing in the three-dimensional world). High-density electroencephalographic recording (72 channels) was performed for analysis of ERPs accompanying perception of each figure type; amplitude differences between the conditions were considered neurophysiologic correlates to perceptual differences between possible and impossible objects. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to identify the current source related to the differences. Compared with impossible three-dimensional figures, perception of possible figures showed a significant negative potential increase in the right inferior occipitotemporal region between 350 and 389 ms of latency. The current source was localized to the right fusiform gyrus. The results suggest that right fusiform gyrus is involved in discrimination between spatially possible and impossible objects. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Random number generation (RNG) requires executive control. A novel paradigm using the eight drum pads of an electronic drum set as an input device was used to test 15 healthy subjects who engaged in random or ordered number generation (ONG). Brain potentials time-locked to the drum-beats revealed a more negative response during RNG compared to ONG which had a left frontal distribution. Source analysis pointed to Brodmann area 9, which has been reported previously in a PET study and is thought to be engaged in suppression of habitual responses such as counting up in steps of one during RNG. Lateralized readiness potentials reflecting the difference in activation of the contra and ipsilateral motor cortex were smaller during ONG reflecting the ability to preprogram such canonical sequences. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Sato MA, Yoshioka T, Kajihara S, Toyama K, Goda N, Doya K, Kawato M: Hierarchical bayesian estimation for meg inverse problem. NeuroImage 2004;23:806-826.<p>
Summary: Source current estimation from MEG measurement is an ill-posed problem that requires prior assumptions about brain activity and an efficient estimation algorithm. In this article, we propose a new hierarchical Bayesian method introducing a hierarchical prior that can effectively incorporate both structural and functional MRI data. In our method, the variance of the source current at each source location is considered an unknown parameter and estimated from the observed MEG data and prior information by using the Variational Bayesian method. The fMRI information can be imposed as prior information on the variance distribution rather than the variance itself so that it gives a soft constraint on the variance. A spatial smoothness constraint, that the neural activity within a few millimeter radius tends to be similar due to the neural connections, can also be implemented as a hierarchical prior. The proposed method provides a unified theory to deal with the following three situations: (1) MEG with no other data, (2) MEG with structural MRI data on cortical surfaces, and (3) MEG with both structural MRI and fMRI data. We investigated the performance of our method and conventional linear inverse methods under these three conditions. Simulation results indicate that our method has better accuracy and spatial resolution than the conventional linear inverse methods under all three conditions. It is also shown that accuracy of our method improves as MRI and fMRI information becomes available. Simulation results demonstrate that our method appropriately resolves the inverse problem even if fMRI data convey inaccurate information, while the Wiener filter method is seriously deteriorated by inaccurate fMRI information. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Journal of Neurology 2004;251:1354-1363.<p>
Summary: The aim of the present study was to identify brain regions associated with vigilance in untreated and modafinil-treated narcoleptic patients by means of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). 16 drug-free narcoleptics and 16 normal controls were included in the baseline investigation. Subsequently patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study receiving a three-week fixed titration of modafinil (200, 300, 400 mg) and placebo. Measurements comprised LORETA, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) obtained before and after three weeks' therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant inter-group differences in the resting (R-EEG), but not in the vigilance-controlled recordings (V-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed a decrease in alpha-2 and beta 1-3 power in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices, with the right hemisphere slightly more involved in this vigilance decrement. Modafinil 400 mg/d as compared with placebo induced changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle) with a preponderance in the left hemisphere. This increase in vigilance resulted in an improvement in the MSLT and the ESS. LORETA provided evidence of a functional deterioration of the fronto-temporo-parietal network of the right-hemispheric vigilance system in narcolepsy and a therapeutic effect of modafinil on the left hemisphere, which is less affected by the disease.<p>

<li>Sabbagh MA, Moulson MC, Harkness KL: Neural correlates of mental state decoding in human adults: An event-related potential study. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 2004;16:415-426.<p>
Summary: Successful negotiation of human social interactions rests on having a theory of mind - an understanding of how others' behaviors can be understood in terms of internal mental states, such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions. A core theory-of-mind skill is the ability to decode others' mental states on the basis of observable information, such as facial expressions. Although several recent studies have focused on the neural correlates of reasoning about mental states, no research has addressed the question of what neural systems underlie mental state decoding. We used dense-array event-related potentials (ERP) to show that decoding mental states from pictures of eyes is associated with an N270-400 component over inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions of the right hemisphere. Source estimation procedures suggest that orbitofrontal and medial temporal regions may underlie this ERP effect. These findings suggest that different components of everyday theory-of-mind skills may rely on dissociable neural mechanisms.<p>

Summary: Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines monoamine oxidase-inhibiting ?-carboline alkaloids with N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic agent showing 5-HT2A agonist activity. In a clinical research setting, ayahuasca has demonstrated a combined stimulatory and psychedelic effect profile, as measured by subjective effect self-assessment instruments and dose-dependent changes in spontaneous brain electrical activity, which parallel the time course of subjective effects. In the present study, the spatial distribution of ayahuasca-induced changes in brain electrical activity was investigated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Electroencephalography recordings were obtained from 18 volunteers after the administration of a dose of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca containing 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight and placebo. The intracerebral power density distribution was computed with LORETA from spectrally analyzed data, and subjective effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for LORETA power 60 and 90 min after dosing, together with increases in all six scales of the HRS. Ayahuasca decreased power density in the alpha-2, delta, theta and beta-1 frequency bands. Power decreases in the delta, alpha-2 and beta-1 bands were found predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, whereas theta power was reduced in the temporomedial cortex and in frontomedial regions. The present results suggest the involvement of unimodal and heteromodal association cortex and limbic structures in the psychological effects elicited by ayahuasca. Copyright © 2004 S.

<li>Pourtois G, Grandjean D, Sander D, Vuilleumier P: Electrophysiological correlates of rapid spatial orienting towards fearful faces. Cerebral Cortex 2004;14:619-633.<p>
Summary: We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamic of attentional bias towards fearful faces. Twelve participants performed a covert spatial orienting task while recording visual event-related brain potentials (VEPs). Each trial consisted of a pair of faces (one emotional and one neutral) briefly presented in the upper visual field, followed by a unilateral bar presented at the location of one of the faces. Participants had to judge the orientation of the bar. Comparing VEPs to bars shown at the location of an emotional (valid) versus neutral (invalid) face revealed an early effect of spatial validity: the lateral occipital P1 component (?130 ms post-stimulus) was selectively increased when a bar replaced a fearful face compared to when the same bar replaced a neutral face. This effect was not found with upright happy faces or inverted fearful faces. A similar amplification of P1 has previously been observed in electrophysiological studies of spatial attention using non-emotional cues. In a behavioural control experiment, participants were also better at discriminating the orientation of the bar when it replaced a fearful rather than a neutral face. In addition, VEPs time-locked to the face-pair onset revealed a C1 component (?90 ms) that was greater for fearful than happy faces. Source localization (LORETA) confirmed an extrastriate origin of the P1 response showing a spatial validity effect, and a striate origin of the C1 response showing an emotional valence effect. These data suggest that activity in primary visual cortex might be enhanced by fear cues as early as 90 ms post-stimulus, and that such effects might result in a subsequent facilitation of sensory processing for a stimulus appearing at the same location. These results provide evidence for neural mechanisms allowing rapid, exogenous spatial orienting of attention towards fear stimuli.<p>

Summary: Major depression is a heterogeneous condition, and the search for neural correlates specific to clinically defined subtypes has been inconclusive. Theoretical considerations implicate frontostriatal, particularly subgenual prefrontal cortex (PFC), dysfunction in the pathophysiology of melancholia - a subtype of depression characterized by anhedonia - but no empirical evidence has been found yet for such a link. To test the hypothesis that melancholic, but not nonmelancholic depression, is associated with the subgenual PFC impairment, concurrent measurement of brain electrical (electroencephalogram, EEG) and metabolic (positron emission tomography, PET) activity were obtained in 38 unmedicated subjects with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (20 melancholic, 18 nonmelancholic subjects), and 18 comparison subjects. EEG data were analyzed with a tomographic source localization method that computed the cortical three-dimensional distribution of current density for standard frequency bands, allowing voxelwise correlations between the EEG and PET data. Voxel-based morphometry analyses of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were performed to assess potential structural abnormalities in melancholia. Melancholia was associated with reduced activity in the subgenual PFC (Brodmann area 25), manifested by increased inhibitory delta activity (1.5-6.0 Hz) and decreased glucose metabolism, which themselves were inversely correlated. Following antidepressant treatment, depressed subjects with the largest reductions in depression severity showed the lowest post-treatment subgenual PFC delta activity. Analyses of structural MRI revealed no group differences in the subgenual PFC, but in melancholic subjects, a negative correlation between gray matter density and age emerged. Based on preclinical evidence, we suggest that subgenual PFC dysfunction in melancholia may be associated with blunted hedonic response and exaggerated stress responsiveness.<p>

Summary: We extended the results of a previous report by further exploring the underlying mechanisms of an electrophysiological index of attention-free memory-based detection mechanism to motion-direction changes in the human visual system. By means of presenting bilateral, right- and left-hemifield stimulation in separate conditions, we tried to assess whether the location of the stimuli within the peripheral visual field affected the processing of motion-direction deviations, and to identify brain regions involved in the detection of unattended infrequent changes of motion direction using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Results indicated that the ERP component related to visual change was not affected by stimulus location, and that bilateral temporal and medial regions were activated during this deviance-related response regardless of the hemifield stimulated. The bilateral activation foci observed in this study suggest that brain generators of this deviance-related component could be located at the vicinity of motion processing areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Parra J, Kalitzin SN, Lopes da Silva FH: Magnetoencephalography: An investigational tool or a routine clinical technique? Epilepsy and Behavior 2004;5:277-285.<p>
Summary: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a relatively novel noninvasive technique, with a much shorter history than EEG, that conveys neurophysiological information complementary to that provided by EEG, with high temporal and spatial resolution. Despite its a priori, highly competitive profile, the role of MEG in the clinical setting is still controversial. We briefly review the major obstacles MEG faces in becoming a routine clinical test and the different strategies needed to bypass them. The high cost and complexity associated with MEG equipment are powerful hindrances to wide acceptance of this relatively new technique in clinical practice. The most straightforward advantage is based on the relative facility of MEG recordings in the process of source localization, which also carries some degree of uncertainty, thus partly explaining why the development of clinical applications of MEG has been so slow. Obviously, a decrease in the cost and the elaboration of semiautomatic protocols that could reduce the complexity of the studies and favor the development of consensual strategies, as well as a major effort on the part of clinicians to identify clinical issues where MEG could be decisive, would be most welcome. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Objective: Epileptic negative myoclonus (ENM), a transient muscular atonic phenomenon time-locked to epileptiform EEG abnormalities, is often observed in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS). In some, for unknown reasons, ENM can be worsened by carbamazepine (CBZ). We describe two children aged 11 and 15 years, in whom CBZ precipitated seizure worsening and ENM. We investigated the morphological and topographic features of the EEG abnormalities while on CBZ and after CBZ withdrawal and compared them with those from 9 children with classical BECTS. The aim of the study was to identify possible electrophysiological specificities in patients who eventually develop ENM during CBZ treatment. Methods: The characterization of EEG abnormalities, related (R) and unrelated to ENM (U), in patients with ENM and rolandic discharges (RD) and in matched controls with BECTS was performed based on polygraphic digital EEG recordings. Off-line time-domain analysis included correlation coefficient between EEG and EMG channels, quantitative analysis on ENM, and topographic analysis on spike-and-wave complexes. Z-score test and paired t test were used when appropriate for statistical analysis on R, U and RD. Results: Recordings in both children with BECTS and ENM while on CBZ showed frequent R discharges (mean interval between R=19.89±9.4 s in patient 1; 2.16±1.2 s in patient 2). Withdrawal of CBZ produced abatement of R (no R recorded in patient 1; 5.69±7.1 s in patient 2) and reduction of the slow wave component of R (P&lt;0.01). Morphology and topography of R and RD differed in field distribution, amplitude (P&lt;0.01) and duration (P&lt;0.01) of the slow wave component. RD and U did not show a significantly different morphology and field distribution. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that an increased cortical inhibition could be the electrophysiological correlate of CBZ-induced ENM. If confirmed on a larger series, the presence of spike-wave (rather than sharp waves) discharges in children with BECTS might be used as an electrophysiological predictor of an abnormal response to CBZ. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Ofek E, Pratt H: Ear advantage and attention: An erp study of auditory cued attention. Hearing Research 2004;189:107-118.<p>
Summary: The neurophysiological manifestations of left ear advantage to tonal stimuli and its interaction with attention have rarely been studied. Cued attention is a behavioral paradigm to assess the behavioral benefits and costs of allocating attention. In this task a cue predicts the location of a subsequent target to which the subject responds. In most cases the cue correctly predicts the target (valid cues) but at times it does not (invalid cues). Cued attention is a spatial paradigm with stimuli presented to either side. The objectives of this study were: (1) to find the neurophysiological correlates of the ear advantage phenomenon and (2) to assess the interaction of the stimulated side (right vs. left ear advantage) with attention, in a cued attention task. Significant effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) in the cued attention task indicated left ear and right hemisphere advantage. Effects were mostly confined to the right hemisphere. The results indicate interactions among left ear advantage, attention and dominant hand utilization. Ear advantage and attention may involve the same neural mechanisms. In spite of the left ear advantage effect on ERP components, hand dominance determines the final behavioral results (reaction times). © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: The relationships between brain electrical and metabolic activity are being uncovered currently in animal models using invasive methods; however, in the human brain this relationship remains not well understood. In particular, the relationship between noninvasive measurements of electrical activity and metabolism remains largely undefined. To understand better these relations, cerebral activity was measured simultaneously with electroencephalography (EEG) and positron emission tomography using [18f] -fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (PET-FDG) in 12 normal human subjects during rest. Intracerebral distributions of current density were estimated, yielding tomographic maps for seven standard EEG frequency bands. The PET and EEG data were registered to the same space and voxel dimensions, and correlational maps were created on a voxel-by-voxel basis across all subjects. For each band, significant positive and negative correlations were found that are generally consistent with extant understanding of EEG band power function. With increasing EEG frequency, there was an increase in the number of positively correlated voxels, whereas the lower ? band (8.5-10.0 Hz) was associated with the highest number of negative correlations. This work presents a method for comparing EEG signals with other more traditionally tomographic functional imaging data on a 3-D basis. This method will be useful in the future when it is applied to functional imaging methods with faster time resolution, such as short half-life PET blood flow tracers and functional magnetic resonance imaging. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 2004;254:190-198.<p>
Summary: The locations and time-courses of the neural generators of the event-related P300 potential have been well described using intracranial recordings. However, this invasive method is not adequate for usage in healthy volunteers or psychiatric patients and not all brain regions can be covered well with this approach. With functional MRI, a non-invasive method with high spatial resolution, most of these locations could be found again. However, the time-course of these activations can only be roughly determined with this method, even if an event-related fMRI design has been chosen. Therefore, we have now tried to analyse the time-course of the activations using EEG data providing a better time resolution. We have used Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) in the analysis of P300 data (27 electrodes) of healthy volunteers (n = 50) in the time frame 230-480 ms and found mainly the same activations that have been described using intracranial recordings or fMRI, i.e. the inferior patrietal lobe/temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In these selected regions, an analysis of the activation time-courses has been performed.<p>

Summary: fMRI and EEG are complimentary methods for the analysis of brain activity since each method has its strength where the other one has limits: The spatial resolution is thus in the range of millimeters with fMRI and the time resolution is in the range of milliseconds with EEG. For a comprehensive understanding of brain activity in target detection, nine healthy subjects (age 24.2 ± 2.9) were investigated with simultaneous EEG (27 electrodes) and fMRI using an auditory oddball paradigm. As a first step, event-related potentials, measured inside the scanner, have been compared with the potentials recorded in a directly preceding session in front of the scanner. Attenuated amplitudes were found inside the scanner for the earlier N1/P2 component but not for the late P300 component. Second, an independent analysis of the localizations of the fMRI activations and the current source density as revealed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been done. Concordant activations were found in most regions, including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula, and the middle frontal gyrus, with a mean Euclidean distance of 16.0 ± 6.6 mm between the BOLD centers of gravity and the LORETA-maxima. Finally, a time-course analysis based on the current source density maxima was done. It revealed different time-course patterns in the left and right hemisphere with earlier activations in frontal and parietal regions in the right hemisphere. The results suggest that the combination of EEG and fMRI permits an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Moffitt MA, Grill WM: Electrical localization of neural activity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: A modeling study. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 2004;32:1694-1709.<p>
Summary: Intraspinal microstimulation is a means of eliciting co-ordinated motor responses for restoration of function. However, detailed maps of the neuroanatomy of the human spinal cord are lacking, and it is not clear where electrodes should be implanted. We developed an electrical approach to localize active neurons in the spinal cord using potentials recorded from the surface of the spinal cord. We evaluated this localization method using an analytical model of the spinal cord and two previously developed inverse algorithms (standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) and a locally optimal source (LOS) method). The results support electrical source localization as a feasible imaging approach for localizing (within 300 ?m) active neurons in the spinal cord. The LOS method could localize the source when 16 recording electrodes were placed on the dorsolateral aspect of the cord and the noise level was 2%. When recording electrodes were positioned around the entire circumference of the spinal cord, either localization method could localize the source, even at 15% noise. Finally, localization error was not sensitive to inaccuracies in the expected electrode positions or the electrical parameters of the forward model, but was sensitive to a geometrical modification of the forward model in one case.<p>

Summary: Finding the means to efficiently summarize electroencephalographic data has been a long-standing problem in electrophysiology. A popular approach is identification of component modes on the basis of the time-varying spectrum of multichannel EEG recordings - in other words, a space/frequency/time atomic decomposition of the time-varying EEG spectrum. Previous work has been limited to only two of these dimensions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used to create space/time decompositions; suffering an inherent lack of uniqueness that is overcome only by imposing constraints of orthogonality or independence of atoms. Conventional frequency/time decompositions ignore the spatial aspects of the EEG. Framing of the data being as a three-way array indexed by channel, frequency, and time allows the application of a unique decomposition that is known as Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). Each atom is the tri-linear decomposition into a spatial, spectral, and temporal signature. We applied this decomposition to the EEG recordings of five subjects during the resting state and during mental arithmetic. Common to all subjects were two atoms with spectral signatures whose peaks were in the theta and alpha range. These signatures were modulated by physiological state, increasing during the resting stage for alpha and during mental arithmetic for theta. Furthermore, we describe a new method (Source Spectra Imaging or SSI) to estimate the location of electric current sources from the EEG spectrum. The topography of the theta atom is frontal and the maximum of the corresponding SSI solution is in the anterior frontal cortex. The topography of the alpha atom is occipital with maximum of the SSI solution in the visual cortex. We show that the proposed decomposition can be used to search for activity with a given spectral and topographic profile in new recordings, and that the method may be useful for artifact recognition and removal. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Michel CM, Murray MM, Lantz G, Gonzalez S, Spinelli L, Grave De Peralta R: Eeg source imaging. Clinical Neurophysiology 2004;115:2195-2222.<p>
Summary: Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for studying the temporal dynamics of the human brain's large-scale neuronal circuits. However, most EEG applications fail to capitalize on all of the data's available information, particularly that concerning the location of active sources in the brain. Localizing the sources of a given scalp measurement is only achieved by solving the so-called inverse problem. By introducing reasonable a priori constraints, the inverse problem can be solved and the most probable sources in the brain at every moment in time can be accurately localized. Methods and Results: Here, we review the different EEG source localization procedures applied during the last two decades. Additionally, we detail the importance of those procedures preceding and following source estimation that are intimately linked to a successful, reliable result. We discuss (1) the number and positioning of electrodes, (2) the varieties of inverse solution models and algorithms, (3) the integration of EEG source estimations with MRI data, (4) the integration of time and frequency in source imaging, and (5) the statistical analysis of inverse solution results. Conclusions and Significance: We show that modern EEG source imaging simultaneously details the temporal and spatial dimensions of brain activity, making it an important and affordable tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Data may now be recorded concurrently from EEG and functional MRI, using the Simultaneous Imaging for Tomographic Electrophysiology (SITE) method. As yet, there is no established means to integrate the analysis of the combined data set. Recognizing that the hemodynamically convolved time-varying EEG spectrum, S, is intrinsically multidimensional in space, frequency, and time motivated us to use multiway Partial Least-Squares (N-PLS) analysis to decompose EEG (independent variable) and fMRI (dependent variable) data uniquely as a sum of &quot;atoms&quot;. Each EEG atom is the outer product of spatial, spectral, and temporal signatures and each fMRI atom the product of spatial and temporal signatures. The decomposition was constrained to maximize the covariance between corresponding temporal signatures of the EEG and fMRI. On all data sets, three components whose spectral peaks were in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands appeared; only the alpha atom had a significant temporal correlation with the fMRI signal. The spatial distribution of the alpha-band atom included parieto-occipital cortex, thalamus, and insula, and corresponded closely to that reported by Goldman et al. [NeuroReport 13(18) (2002) 2487] using a more conventional analysis. The source reconstruction from EEG spatial signature showed only the parieto-occipital sources. We interpret these results to indicate that some electrical sources may be intrinsically invisible to scalp EEG, yet may be revealed through conjoint analysis of EEG and fMRI data. These results may also expose brain regions that participate in the control of brain rhythms but may not themselves be generators. As of yet, no single neuroimaging method offers the optimal combination of spatial and temporal resolution; fusing fMRI and EEG meaningfully extends the spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity of each method. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: A method for the exploratory analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data for neurophysiological experiments is presented. It is based on a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG time series, which is measured by several electrodes in the scalp surface, and includes the computation of a statistic that measures the deviations of the log-power with respect to the pre-stimulus average; the computation of a significance index for these deviations; a new type of display (the time-frequency-topography plot) for the visualization of these indices, and the segmentation of the time-frequency plane into regions with uniform activation patterns. As a particular example, an experiment to study EEG changes during figure and word categorization is analyzed in detail. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: This paper focuses on the application of quantitative electric tomography (qEEGT) to map changes in EEG generators for detection of early signs of ischemia in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke. Thirty-two patients were studied with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke of the left middle cerebral artery territory, within the first 24 hours of their clinical evolution. Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography was used for estimating EEG source generators. High resolution source Z-spectra and 3-dimensional images of Z values for all the sources at each frequency were obtained for all cases. To estimate statistically significant increments and decrements of brain electric activity within the frequency spectra, the t-Student vs. Zero test was performed. A significant increment of delta activity was observed on the affected vascular territory, and a more extensive increment of theta activity was detected. Asignificant alpha decrement was found in the parieto-occipital region of the affected cerebral hemisphere (left), and in the medial and posterior region of the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that qEEGT Z delta images are probably related to the main ischemic core within the affected arterial territory; penumbra, diaschisis, edema, might explain those observed theta and alpha abnormalities. It was concluded that qEEGT is useful for the detection of early signs of ischemia in acute ischemic stroke.<p>

Summary: Estimation of intracranial electric activity from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) requires a solution to the EEG inverse problem, which is known as an ill-conditioned problem. In order to yield a unique solution, weighted minimum norm least square (MNLS) inverse methods are generally used. This paper proposes a recursive algorithm, termed Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS, which combines and expands upon the central features of two well-known weighted MNLS methods: LORETA and FOCUSS. This recursive algorithm makes iterative adjustments to the solution space as well as the weighting matrix, thereby dramatically reducing the computation load, and increasing local source resolution. Simulations are conducted on a 3-shell spherical head model registered to the Talairach human brain atlas. A comparative study of four different inverse methods, standard Weighted Minimum Norm, L1-norm, LORETA-FOCUSS and Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS are presented. The results demonstrate that Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS is able to reconstruct a three-dimensional source distribution with smaller localization and energy errors compared to the other methods.<p>

Summary: In human electrophysiology, a considerable corpus of studies using event-related potentials have investigated inhibitory processes by employing the 'go-nogo' paradigm, which requires responding to one type of event while withholding the response to another type of event. Two event-related potential waveform features (N2 and P3) have been associated with larger amplitude in nogo trials than in go trials. Traditionally, these differences were thought to reflect response inhibition. Recently, the source localization of N2 to the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the colocalization of N2 with error-related negativity, has been interpreted in terms of conflict monitoring. In order to isolate the contribution of inhibitory processes, we matched the frequency of the go and nogo events, thus minimizing differences in response conflict between event types. A data-driven analytical procedure contrasted go with nogo events across the entire event-related potential segment and found that N2 reliably differentiated between the two conditions while P3 did not. Tomographical analyses of the N2 difference observed in conditions of equal go and nogo trial frequency localized N2 to the right ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Because a growing body of evidence implicates these brain regions in inhibitory processes, we conclude that N2 does, at least in part, reflect inhibition.<p>

Summary: Objective: Dipole models, which are frequently used in attempts to solve the electromagnetic inverse problem, require explicit a priori assumptions about the cerebral current sources. This is not the case for solutions based on minimum-norm estimates. In the present study, we evaluated the spatial accuracy of the L2 minimum-norm estimate (MNE) in realistic noise conditions by assessing its ability to localize sources of evoked responses at the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Methods: Multichannel somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and magnetic fields (SEFs) were recorded in 5 subjects while stimulating the median and ulnar nerves at the left wrist. A Tikhonov-regularized L2-MNE, constructed on a spherical surface from the SEP signals, was compared with an equivalent current dipole (ECD) solution obtained from the SEFs. Results: Primarily tangential current sources accounted for both SEP and SEF distributions at around 20 ms (N20/N20m) and 70 ms (P70/P70m), which deflections were chosen for comparative analysis. The distances between the locations of the maximum current densities obtained from MNE and the locations of ECDs were on the average 12-13 mm for both deflections and nerves stimulated. In accordance with the somatotopical order of SI, both the MNE and ECD tended to localize median nerve activation more laterally than ulnar nerve activation for the N20/N20m deflection. Simulation experiments further indicated that, with a proper estimate of the source depth and with a good fit of the head model, the MNE can reach a mean accuracy of 5 mm in 0.2-?V root-mean-square noise. Conclusions: When compared with previously reported localizations based on dipole modelling of SEPs, it appears that equally accurate localization of S1 can be obtained with the MNE. Significance: MNE can be used to verify parametric source modelling results. Having a relatively good localization accuracy and requiring minimal assumptions, the MNE may be useful for the localization of poorly known activity distributions and for tracking activity changes between brain areas as a function of time. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Imaging studies and quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) have often, but not consistently, implicated the left hemisphere and the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. To help clarify this picture, a spatial filter shown to be effective for enhancing differences between EEG populations was combined with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography and used to compare the source-current densities from a group of 57 male subjects with schizophrenia and a group of 65 matched controls. To elicit differences, comparisons were made during resting conditions and during verbal and spatial cognitive challenges to the subjects. Estimates of the source-current density were derived from 43-electrode recordings of the EEG reduced to the delta, alpha and beta frequency bands. The patients were unmedicated and were selected according to DSM-IV criteria. As a group, they were severe, chronic states with both deficit negative and superimposed florid psychotic symptomatology. The results confirm that schizophrenia is a left-hemispheric disorder centered in the temporal and frontal lobes. They also suggest that, in schizophrenia, functions normally performed by these regions in controls are assumed by homologous regions in the opposite hemispheres. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Summary: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neural substrates underlying event-related potential (ERP) abnormalities, with respect to the generators of the ERP components in depressed patients. Using an oddball paradigm, ERP from auditory stimuli were recorded from 22 unmedicated patients with current depressive episodes and compared with those from 22 age- and gender-matched normal controls. Cortical current densities of the N100 and P300 components were analyzed using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Group differences in cortical current density were mapped on a 3-D cortex model. The results revealed that N100 cortical current densities did not differ between the two groups, while P300 cortical current densities were significantly lower in depressed patients over the bilateral temporal lobes, the left frontal region, and the right temporal-parietal area. Furthermore, the cortical area in which the group difference in P300 current density had been identified was remarkably larger over the right than the left hemisphere, thus supporting the hypothesis of right hemisphere dysfunction in depression.<p>

Summary: The generation of random sequences is considered to tax different executive functions. To explore the involvement of these functions further, brain potentials were recorded in 16 healthy young adults while either engaging in random number generation (RNG) by pressing the number keys on a computer keyboard in a random sequence or in ordered number generation (ONG) necessitating key presses in the canonical order. Key presses were paced by an external auditory stimulus to yield either fast (1 press/800 ms) or slow (1 press/1300 ms) sequences in separate runs. Attentional demands of random and ordered tasks were assessed by the introduction of a secondary task (key-press to a target tone). The P3 amplitude to the target tone of this secondary task was reduced during RNG, reflecting the greater consumption of attentional resources during RNG. Moreover, RNG led to a left frontal negativity peaking 140 ms after the onset of the pacing stimulus, whenever the subjects produced a true random response. This negativity could be attributed to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and was absent when numbers were repeated. This negativity was interpreted as an index for the inhibition of habitual responses. Finally, in response locked ERPs a negative component was apparent peaking about 50 ms after the key-press that was more prominent during RNG. Source localization suggested a medial frontal source. This effect was tentatively interpreted as a reflection of the greater monitoring demands during random sequence generation. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and The Japan Neuroscience Society.

<li>Horovitz SG, Rossion B, Skudlarski P, Gore JC: Parametric design and correlational analyses help integrating fmri and electrophysiological data during face processing. NeuroImage 2004;22:1587-1595.<p>
Summary: Face perception is typically associated with activation in the inferior occipital, superior temporal (STG), and fusiform gyri (FG) and with an occipitotemporal electrophysiological component peaking around 170 ms on the scalp, the N170. However, the relationship between the N170 and the multiple face-sensitive activations observed in neuroimaging is unclear. It has been recently shown that the amplitude of the N170 component monotonically decreases as gaussian noise is added to a picture of a face [Jemel et al., 2003]. To help clarify the sources of the N170 without a priori assumptions regarding their number and locations, ERPs and fMRI were recorded in five subjects in the same experiment, in separate sessions. We used a parametric paradigm in which the amplitude of the N170 was modulated by varying the level of noise in a picture, and identified regions where the percent signal change in fMRI correlated with the ERP data. N170 signals were observed for pictures of both cars and faces but were stronger for faces. A monotonic decrease with added noise was observed for the N170 at right hemisphere sites but was less clear on the left and occipital central sites. Correlations between fMRI signal and N170 amplitudes for faces were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) in bilateral fusiform gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. For cars, the strongest correlations were observed in the parahippocampal region and in the STG (P &lt; 0.005). Besides contributing to clarify the spatiotemporal course of face processing, this study illustrates how ERP information may be used synergistically in fMRI analyses. Parametric designs may be developed further to provide some timing information on fMRI activity and help identify the generators of ERP signals. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: We investigated error processing of 39 subjects engaging the Eriksen flanker task. In all 39 subjects a pronounced negative deflection (ERN/Ne) and a later positive component (Pe) were observed after incorrect as compared to correct responses. The neural sources of both components were analyzed using LORETA source localization. For the negative component (ERN/Ne) we found significantly higher brain electrical activity in medial prefrontal areas for incorrect responses, whereas the positive component (Pe) was localized nearby but more rostral within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Thus, different neural generators were found for the ERN/Ne and the Pe, which further supports the notion that both error-related components represent different aspects of error processing. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Summary: This study investigates whether LORETA, a method of source localization of EEG data, reveals replicable and valid sources of event-related potentials (ERPs), which are supposed to be generated in a widespread cortical network. For that purpose, the ERPs in a rare primer (=target) and frequent distractor condition(=nontarget) of a visually presented Continuous Performance Test (CPT) were analyzed in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n1=49,n2=38). At about 420 ms significantly higher global field power values (GFP) were observed in the target condition as compared to the nontarget condition. For both samples the LORETA source localization revealed significantly higher activation for the target-condition as compared to the nontarget condition in the anterior cingulum, the precuneus and superior-posterior parietal cortex parietal lobe), the insula, and the fusiform gyrus (temporal lobe). Only in the second sample were widespread areas in the frontal cortex also activated. The results indicate that LORETA localizes widespread cortical areas involved in target processing similar to results of fMRI studies. © 2004 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.<p>

International Journal of Audiology 2004;43Summary: The current preliminary report describes the utilization of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) in a small group of highly performing children using the Nucleus 22 cochlear implant (CI) and in normal-hearing (NH) adults. LORETA current density estimations were performed on an averaged target P3 component that was elicited by non-speech and speech oddball discrimination tasks. The results indicated that, when stimulated with tones, patients with right implants and NH adults (regardless of stimulated ear) showed enhanced activation in the right temporal lobe, whereas patients with left implants showed enhanced activation in the left temporal lobe. When stimulated with speech, patients with right implants showed bilateral activation of the temporal and frontal lobes, whereas patients with left implants showed only left temporal lobe activation. NH adults (regardless of stimulated ear) showed enhanced bilateral activation of the temporal and parietal lobes. The differences in activation patterns between patients with CI and NH subjects may be attributed to the long-term exposure to degraded input conditions which may have resulted in reorganization in terms of functional specialization. The difference between patients with right versus left implants, however, is intriguing and requires further investigation.<p>

Summary: The EEG of 10 normal male young adults was recorded during the performance of three different tasks: mental calculation, verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM). The stimuli used in the three tasks were the same, only the instructions to the subjects were different. Narrow band analysis of the EEG and distributed sources for each EEG frequency were calculated using variable resolution electromagnetic tomography (VARETA). At some frequencies (1.56, 4.68, 7.80 to 10.92 Hz) at least two tasks produced similar EEG patterns that were interpreted as the reflex of common cognitive processes, such as attention, inhibition of irrelevant stimuli, etc. Specific changes were also observed at 2.34, 3.12, 3.90, 5.46 and 6.24 Hz. The first three of these frequencies showed similar changes during VWM and calculus at the left frontal cortex, suggesting the activation of working memory (WM) processes. The interaction effect at these frequencies was mainly observed at the anterior cingulate cortex and frontal cortex. At 5.46 and 6.24 Hz, changes were only observed during mental calculation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Halgren E: How can intracranial recordings assist meg source localization? Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology 2004;2004Summary: MEG/EEG are the only non-invasive methods to instantaneously and directly measure the currents underlying cerebral information processing, but their ability to localize those currents is limited. Source localization from MEG is always uncertain, unless the signal is already known to be coming exclusively from a single focal source, or a few highly separated focal sources. Furthermore, since many cerebral currents produce little or no MEG signal, even accurate localization of the MEG sources may provide a very incomplete map of brain activation. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) can unambiguously localize sources, using steep voltage gradients, doubly-inverting gradients, traverses of the source structure from multiple directions, and/or spatial arrays of microelectrodes. These recordings show that except for a few milliseconds after the first cortical sensory response, multiple overlapping sources are active. For the commonly-studied cognitive potential components, N400 and P3b, iEEG demonstrates distributed sources in multiple lobes with similar time-courses. These data, as well as basic cortical neurophysiology from animal studies, do not support the common assumptions that the MEG generating sources are focal, and/or independent. Although focal hemodynamic activation is often described, this may be an artefact of the usual data analysis schemes. In summary, MEG source localization depends on prior assumptions of unknown accuracy, and MEG is insensitive to much cerebral activity. MEG publications should explicitly acknowledge these limitations. If possible, reference should be made to more certain knowledge, which in some cases includes iEEG.<p>

<li>Greenblatt RE, Pflieger ME: Randomization-based hypothesis testing from event-related data. Brain Topography 2004;16:225-232.<p>
Summary: Methods are described for non-parametric significance testing from event-related encephalographic data, using randomization tests. These methods may be applied in both signal space and source space. The methods include within-subject between-condition comparisons, paired and unpaired comparisons, and within-group and between-group comparisons. Test statistics are also derived for comparing the spatial or temporal response patterns, independent of specific changes at individual locations. Novel methods for testing peak-height significance, and also for making map-wide comparisons, are described. These methods have been validated using simulated data.<p>

Summary: We investigated learning-related changes in amplitude, scalp topography, and source localization of the mismatch negativity (MMN), a neurophysiological response correlated with auditory discrimination ability. Participants (n = 32) underwent two EEG recordings while they watched silent films and ignored auditory stimuli. Stimuli were a standard (probability = 85%) and two deviant (probability = 7.5% each for high [HD] and low [LD]) eight-tone sequences that differed in the frequency of one tone. Between recordings, subjects practiced discriminating the HD or LD from the standard for 6 min. The amplitude of the LD MMN increased significantly across recordings in both groups, whereas the amplitude of the HD MMN did not. The LD was easier to discriminate than was the HD. Thus, practicing either discrimination increased the MMN for the easier discrimination. Learning and changes in the LD MMN amplitude were highly correlated. Source localizations of event-related potentials (ERPs) to all stimuli revealed bilateral sources in superior temporal regions. Compared with the standard ERP, the LD ERP revealed a stronger source in the left superior temporal region in both recordings, whereas the right-sided source became stronger after learning. Consistent with prior studies of auditory plasticity in animals and humans, tone sequence learning induced rapid neurophysiological plasticity in the human central auditory system. The results also suggest that there is asymmetric hemispheric involvement in tone sequence discrimination learning and that discrimination difficulty influences the time course of learning-related neurophysiological changes.<p>

<li>Gotman J, Be?nar CG, Dubeau F: Combining eeg and fmri in epilepsy: Methodological challenges and clinical results. Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology 2004;21:229-240.<p>
Summary: It is now possible to combine continuous recording of the EEG and continuous functional MRI scanning. This makes it possible to determine the regions of the brain showing changes in the fMRI signal in response to epileptic spikes occurring in the EEG. This article reviews the experience with this method in more than 100 studies performed over the last 4 years at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The technique is complex, and the authors review the various issues related to obtaining a good-quality EEG in the hostile environment of the magnetic resonance scanner, the statistical analysis of magnetic resonance images, in particular the issue of knowing what is the hemodynamic response function appropriate for the analysis of epileptic spikes, and the combination of EEG and fMRI results. The difficult theoretical issues raised by the interpretation of activation and deactivation, both frequently seen in response to spikes, are discussed. Finally, the authors give examples of fMRI responses seen with focal spikes and with generalized spike and wave discharges.<p>

Summary: The objective of this study was to determine the validity of interictal spike (IIS) source localization in temporal lobe epilepsies (TLE) using stereoelectroencephalography as a validating method. Twenty patients with drug-resistant TLE were studied with high-resolution EEG and stereoelectroencephalography. Sixty-four scalp channels, a realistic head model, and different algorithms were used. For each patient, the intracerebral interictal distribution was studied and classified into one of three groups: L (mainly lateral), ML (mediolateral), and M (medial). In group L (three patients), surface IIS were recorded with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Source localizations designated all or part of the intracerebral interictal distribution. In group ML (11 patients), 8 patients had surface IIS, only 5 of which were localizable. High-resolution EEG permitted localization of the more lateral portion and definition of its rostrocaudal extension. A common pattern was identified in three patients with a predominant role of the temporal pole. In group M (six patients), four patients had rare surface IIS, none of which were localizable. Surface EEG does not record IIS limited to medial temporal lobe structures. In TLE with a mediolateral or a lateral interictal distribution, only the lateral component is detectable on surface EEG and accurately localizable by source localization tools.<p>

Summary: The complementary strengths and weaknesses of established functional brain imaging methods (high spatial, low temporal resolution) and EEG-based techniques (low spatial, high temporal resolution) make their combined use a promising avenue for studying brain processes at a more fine-grained level. However, this strategy requires a better understanding of the relationship between hemodynamic/metabolic and neuroelectric measures of brain activity. We investigated possible correspondences between cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by [H2O]-PET and intracerebral electric activity computed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from scalp-recorded multichannel EEG in healthy human subjects during cognitive and pharmacological stimulation. The two imaging modalities were compared by descriptive, correlational, and variance analyses, the latter carried out using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Descriptive visual comparison showed a partial overlap between the sets of active brain regions detected by the two modalities. A number of exclusively positive correlations of neuroelectric activity with regional CBF were found across the whole EEG frequency range, including slow wave activity, the latter finding being in contrast to most previous Studies Conducted in patients. Analysis of variance revealed an extensive lack of statistically significant correspondences between brain activity changes as measured by PET vs. EEG-LORETA. In general, correspondences, to the extent they were found, were dependent on experimental condition, brain region, and EEG frequency. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: We present a new approach for estimating solutions of the dynamical inverse problem of EEG generation. In contrast to previous approaches, we reinterpret this problem as a filtering problem in a state space framework; for the purpose of its solution, we propose a new extension of Kalman filtering to the case of spatiotemporal dynamics. The temporal evolution of the distributed generators of the EEG can be reconstructed at each voxel of a discretisation of the gray matter of brain. By fitting linear autoregressive models with neighbourhood interactions to EEG time series, new classes of inverse solutions with improved resolution and localisation ability can be explored. For the purposes of model comparison and parameter estimation from given data, we employ a likelihood maximisation approach. Both for instantaneous and dynamical inverse solutions, we derive estimators of the time-dependent estimation error at each voxel. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by application to simulated and clinical EEG recordings. It is shown that by choosing appropriate dynamical models, it becomes possible to obtain inverse solutions of considerably improved quality, as compared to the usual instantaneous inverse solutions. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: The problem of estimating unobserved states of spatially extended dynamical systems poses an inverse problem, which can be solved approximately by a recently developed variant of Kalman filtering; in order to provide the model of the dynamics with more flexibility with respect to space and time, we suggest to combine the concept of GARCH modelling of covariance, well known in econometrics, with Kalman filtering. We formulate this algorithm for spatiotemporal systems governed by stochastic diffusion equations and demonstrate its feasibility by presenting a numerical simulation designed to imitate the situation of the generation of electroencephalographic recordings by the human cortex. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

<li>Fuchs M, Ford MR, Sands S, Lew HL: Overview of dipole source localization. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America 2004;15:251-262.<p>
Summary: Truly accurate dipole source localization relies on having (1) reliable, artifact-free EP/ERP (or magnetoelectroencephalogram) data to start with; (2) landmark and electrode position data obtained with a three-dimensional digitizer; (3) MRI (or CT) data from the same subject (with a means to measure the same landmarks); (4) the capability to apply different dipole and volume conductor models; and (5) the ability to coregister the functional and anatomic data to display the final source solutions. Most important is to have a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of the localization programs and neurophysiologic processes. Localization programs are simply tools. Used incorrectly, they can yield meaningless results. Used correctly, they can provide a window into neurophysiologic functioning that is not available through any other means.<p>

<li>Fontanarosa JB, Lasky RE, Lee HC, Van Drongelen W: Localization of brainstem auditory evoked potentials in primates: A comparison of localization techniques applied to deep brain sources. Brain Topography 2004;17:99-108.<p>
Summary: Summary: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of source localization techniques through localization of deep brain sources. To accomplish this, two replications of a brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP, left ear 60 dB nHL clicks) were recorded from five normal rhesus monkeys. We analyzed waves III and IV, as this portion of the BAEP corresponds to the deepest signal. Data were analyzed using five different source localization techniques: Moving Dipoles, Fixed Dipoles, MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) dipole scan, LORETA (Low Resolution Tomography), and LCMV (Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance) spatial filtering. The moving dipole, fixed dipole and MUSIC solutions were found to be, on average, 25.1 mm from the brainstem generators. LORETA detected sources within the brainstem 65% of the time. However, 90% of these localization results also included false detections defined as regions of the brain that were more than 2 cm away from the auditory pathway. LCMV included the brainstem in 90% of the trials and false detections in 40% of the cases. These findings indicate that evoked electrical activity from deep brain sources can be localized with cm accuracy. The dipole methods performed better than LORETA and LCMV. Given the depth and amplitude of the sources analyzed in this study, these results can be interpreted as an upper bound on the accuracy of each technique.<p>

Summary: Imaging studies and quantitative EEG have often, but not consistently, implicated the right hemisphere and the left prefrontal cortex in depression. To help clarify this picture, a spatial filter shown to be effective for enhancing differences between EEG populations was combined with an electrical tomographic approach called low-resolution electromagnetic tomography and used to compare the source-current densities from a group of 25 male subjects with depression and a group of 65 matched controls. To elicit differences, comparisons were made during resting conditions and during verbal and spatial cognitive challenges to the subjects. Estimates of the source-current density were derived from 43-electrode recordings of the EEG reduced to the delta, alpha and beta frequency bands. The depressed subjects were unmedicated and selected according to DSM IV criteria. Regions of significantly increased current density in depression compared to controls were generally right hemispheric, while regions of significantly decreased current density were generally frontal and left hemispheric. A within-group comparison of the depressed subjects during the two cognitive challenges suggested a left anterior functional hypoactivation in depression. Retrospective classification of the two groups indicated that the spatial challenge best separated the groups irrespective of frequency band. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Objective: To investigate mechanisms and structures underlying prefrontal response control and inhibition in boys suffering from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Sixteen boys with ADHD and 19 healthy controls were investigated electrophysiologically during performance of a visual Go-Nogo task (Continuous Performance Test, CPT). An electrophysiological source localization method was employed to further analyze the data. Results: The ADHD boys showed a significantly diminished central Nogo-P3, due to a lack of Nogo-related frontalization of the positive brain electrical field in this group. This two-dimensional effect was associated with a significantly reduced activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the ADHD boys in the Nogo condition of the CPT. Both groups did not significantly differ regarding the amplitude of the Nogo-N2. Conclusions: The results indicate deficits in prefrontal response control in unmedicated ADHD boys that do not seem to be specifically inhibitory in nature. A supposed dysfunction of the ACC in ADHD was confirmed. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: The aims of the present study were to identify brain regions involved in emotional processing as well as to follow the time sequence of these processes in the millisecond-range resolution using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Different emotional (happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgust) and neutral faces were presented to 17 healthy, right-handed volunteers on a computer screen while 25-channel EEG data were recorded. Subjects were instructed to generate the same emotion as shown in the presented faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were computed for each emotion and neutral condition, and analyzed as sequences of potential distribution maps. Paired topographic analysis of variance tests of the ERP maps identified time segments of significant differences between responses to emotional and neutral faces. For these significant segments, statistical analyses of functional LORETA images were performed to identify active brain regions for the different emotions. Significant differences occurred in different time segments within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset. Each emotional condition showed specific activation patterns in different brain regions, changing over time. In the majority of significant time segments, activation was highest in the right frontal areas. Strongest activation was found in the happy, sad, and disgust conditions in extended fronto-temporal areas. Happy, sad, and disgust conditions also produced earlier and more widely distributed differences than anger and fear. Our findings are in good agreement with other brain-imaging studies (PET/fMRI). But unlike other imaging techniques, LORETA allows to follow the time sequence in the millisecond-range resolution. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Darvas F, Pantazis D, Kucukaltun-Yildirim E, Leahy RM: Mapping human brain function with meg and eeg: Methods and validation. NeuroImage 2004;23Summary: We survey the field of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source estimation. These modalities offer the potential for functional brain mapping with temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, the limited number of spatial measurements and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem present significant limits to our ability to produce accurate spatial maps from these data without imposing major restrictions on the form of the inverse solution. Here we describe approaches to solving the forward problem of computing the mapping from putative inverse solutions into the data space. We then describe the inverse problem in terms of low dimensional solutions, based on the equivalent current dipole (ECD), and high dimensional solutions, in which images of neural activation are constrained to the cerebral cortex. We also address the issue of objective assessment of the relative performance of inverse procedures by the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We conclude with a discussion of methods for assessing statistical significance of experimental results through use of the bootstrap for determining confidence regions in dipole-fitting methods, and random field (RF) and permutation methods for detecting significant activation in cortically constrained imaging studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Congedo M, Lubar JF, Joffe D: Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography neurofeedback. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering 2004;12:387-397.<p>
Summary: Through continuous feedback of the electroencephalogram (EEG) humans can learn how to shape their brain electrical activity in a desired direction. The technique is known as EEG biofeedback, or neurofeedback, and has been used since the late 1960s in research and clinical applications. A major limitation of neurofeedback relates to the limited information provided by a single or small number of electrodes placed on the scalp. We establish a method for extracting and feeding back intracranial current density and we carry out an experimental study to ascertain the ability of the participants to drive their own EEG power in a desired direction. To derive current density within the brain volume, we used the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Six undergraduate students (three males, three females) underwent tomographic neurofeedback (based on 19 electrodes placed according to the 10-20 system) to enhance the current density power ratio between the frequency bands ? (16-20 Hz) and a (8-10 Hz). According to LORETA modeling, the region of interest corresponded to the Anterior Cingulate (cognitive division). The protocol was designed to improve the performance of the subjects on the dimension of sustained attention. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) that the ?/? current density power ratio increased over sessions and 2) that by the end of the training subjects acquired the ability of increasing that ratio at will. Both hypotheses received substantial experimental support in this study. This is the first application of an EEG inverse solution to neurofeedback. Possible applications of the technique include the treatment of epileptic foci, the rehabilitation of specific brain regions damaged as a consequence of traumatic brain injury and, in general, the training of any spatial specific cortical electrical activity. These findings may also have relevant consequences for the development of brain-computer interfaces.<p>

Summary: Summary: Though, traditionally, electrophysiological recordings have been limited to provide temporal information on neural activity, the development of mathematical algorithms capable of solving the inverse problem is facilitating, in recent years, the access to spatial information (i.e., on the origin of neural activation). This study explored a new strategy in order to increase the reliability of inverse problem solutions: applying these algorithms on factor scores (and not on voltages), a parameter that can be defined as &quot;clean amplitude&quot;. Factor scores derive from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to event-related potentials (ERPs). The main advantage of PCA is its capability to extract and quantify ERP components free of the influence of adjacent or subjacent components. The LORETA algorithm for source localization was applied on peak voltage, average voltage and factor scores for the motor potential recorded from 25 subjects, who had to repeatedly press a button with their right hand. The solutions given by LORETA in these three modalities were compared. The motor potential, a negative wave that begins just before any voluntary movement and is centrally distributed in the scalp, is particularly useful to the scope of this study, since its origin is known: contralateral motor cortex. Results show that the three modalities (peak voltage, mean voltage and factor scores) provided the same main focus (left motor cortex), though the &quot;cleanest&quot; solution (i.e., the main focus was more salient with respect to other secondary, noisy foci) was achieved by the factor score-based LORETA.<p>

<li>Carretie L, Hinojosa JA, Marti?n-Loeches M, Mercado F, Tapia M: Automatic attention to emotional stimuli: Neural correlates. Human Brain Mapping 2004;22:290-299.<p>
Summary: We investigated the capability of emotional and nonemotional visual stimulation to capture automatic attention, an aspect of the interaction between cognitive and emotional processes that has received scant attention from researchers. Event-related potentials were recorded from 37 subjects using a 60-electrode array, and were submitted to temporal and spatial principal component analyses to detect and quantify the main components, and to source localization software (LORETA) to determine their spatial origin. Stimuli capturing automatic attention were of three types: emotionally positive, emotionally negative, and nonemotional pictures. Results suggest that initially (P1: 105 msec after stimulus), automatic attention is captured by negative pictures, and not by positive or nonemotional ones. Later (P2: 180 msec), automatic attention remains captured by negative pictures, but also by positive ones. Finally (N2: 240 msec), attention is captured only by positive and nonemotional stimuli. Anatomically, this sequence is characterized by decreasing activation of the visual association cortex (VAC) and by the growing involvement, from dorsal to ventral areas, of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Analyses suggest that the ACC and not the VAC is responsible for experimental effects described above. Intensity, latency, and location of neural activity related to automatic attention thus depend clearly on the stimulus emotional content and on its associated biological importance. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Electrophysiological (EEG/MEG) imaging challenges statistics by providing two views of the same spatiotemporal data: topographic and tomographic. Until now, statistical tests for these two situations have developed separately. This work introduces statistical tests for assessing simultaneously the significance of spatiotemporal event-related potential/event-related field (ERP/ERF) components and that of their sources. The test for detecting a component at a given time instant is provided by a Hotelling's T2 statistic. This statistic is constructed in such a manner to be invariant to any choice of reference and is based upon a generalized version of the average reference transform of the data. As a consequence, the proposed test is a generalization of the well-known Global Field Power statistic. Consideration of tests at all time instants leads to a multiple comparison problem addressed by the use of Random Field Theory (RFT). The Union-Intersection (UI) principle is the basis for testing hypotheses about the topographic and tomographic distributions of such ERP/ERF components. The performance of the method is illustrated with actual EEG recordings obtained from a visual experiment of pattern reversal stimuli. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Background. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) in visualizing limbic structures and possibly identifying electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies in the limbic region during an anger memory recall process. Method. This study was conducted with twelve subjects, non-clinical students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. A pre-study screening was conducted. Eyes-open baselines were obtained employing 300 epochs, or five minutes, using a 19-channel quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) acquisition system with linked ear reference. The experimental condition recording directly followed an eyes-open baseline. The experimental condition was to allocate a memory that created intense anger and retain the state as long as possible. All files were no less than 100 total epochs upon editing. The data were analyzed in both individual and group conditions with LORETA imaging software. Statistical differences between conditions were evaluated for significance, then computed and transformed into LORETA images. Results. The data revealed significant differences between the anger condition and baseline recordings in limbic structures and frontal regions. The data suggests that limbic lobe and hippocampal activity can be recorded and visualized using LORETA during affective memory recall. There are several notable differences between the baseline and condition images. One of the more interesting of these differences is possible activation of the amygdala, uncinate gyrus and surrounding structures in the beta (12-32 Hz) frequencies. The hemispheric asymmetries during anger memory recall offer further support for the lateralization of hemispheric activity relating to affective states. Conclusion. LORETA may be an effective method used to differentiate and visualize limbic lobe, hippocampal formation and other related structures during affective anger memory recall. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Summary: N400 event-related potential (ERP) components have been observed during semantic incongruity detection in language, face identity and/or expression. However, it is still unclear whether semantic processing is functionally equivalent, since no study has directly investigated within the same participants the occurrence of the N400s for language and faces. We recorded ERPs while subjects performed incongruity detection on words, facial identities and facial expressions, with conditions matched to involve context integration. N400s were identified on central-parietal electrodes only for language and face identity processing. Scalp topographies of these N400s differed but a LORETA inverse solution identified a common functional generator in the left lateral frontal cortex, suggesting a general role of this brain region in selecting and contextually integrating semantic information. © 2004 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

<li>Bu?cker HM, Beucker R: Using automatic differentiation for the solution of the minimum p-norm estimation problem in magnetoencephalography. Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory 2004;12:105-116.<p>
Summary: The minimum-norm estimate is a popular reconstruction technique to localize the electrical activity on the human cortex for given measurements of a magnetic field outside the head. The standard approach minimizes the Euclidean norm of the current density distribution of the underlying dipole moments. However, for certain magnetic fields whose current density distribution is known to be focal, the traditional approach based on the Euclidean norm tends to over-smooth the reconstructions. To overcome these difficulties, a minimum p-norm approach with 1&lt;p&lt;2 is taken to increase the focality when p approaches unity. A Newton-type optimization algorithm is investigated in order to avoid potential numerical instabilities caused by reweighted least-squares algorithms. The reverse mode of automatic differentiation is used to efficiently evaluate the underlying gradient of the cost function. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: The aim of the present study was to examine differences among 'regular' and dyslexic adult bilingual readers when processing reading and reading related skills in their first (L1 Hebrew) and second (L2 English) languages. Brain activity during reading Hebrew and English unexpected sentence endings was also studied. Behavioral and electrophysiological measures including event-related potentials (ERP) and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) methodology were employed. Results indicated discrepancies in the processing profiles of dyslexic and regular bilingual readers in both first and second languages. In general, the amplitudes of the evoked potentials were higher and the latencies longer among dyslexic readers during processing of information in first and second languages (L1 and L2), but were more pronounced in English (L2). LORETA analysis indicated evidence that the source of brain activity measured by current density of brain activation is different when reading Hebrew as compared to English sentences mainly among dyslexies and not among regular readers. The data from the present study supports the 'dominanat bilingual' hypothesis for defining bilinguals. A discrepancy between achievement in performing various L1 and L2 tasks was consistent across groups. Both groups were better in there mother tongue, which was Hebrew as compared to English.<p>

Neuropsychobiology 2004;49:134-153.<p>
Summary: Electrical sources of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) determined by means of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) in 48 unmedicated insomniac postmenopausal patients aged between 46 and 67 years were compared with those obtained in 48 age-matched normal female controls. Subsequently, the patients were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized 3-arm trial phase - Climodien 2/3 [estradiol valerate (EV) 2 mg + the progestin dienogest 3 mg] was compared with EV 2 mg and placebo - followed by an open-label phase in which all of them received Climodien 2/2 (EV 2 mg + dienogest 2 mg). The double-blind and the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone oddball paradigm and electrical sources of standard N1 and P2 as well as target N2 and P300 components were estimated. In both patients and controls, LORETA revealed an activation of the superior temporal gyrus [auditory cortex, Brodmann areas (BA) 41, 42, 22] for all four components. For standard P2, an additional activation was observed medially parietally in the precuneus (BA 7, 5). For target N2, also a medial frontal source (BA 9, 10, 32) was identified. Finally, for the target P300 component - in addition to the aforementioned sources - activations in the prefrontal cortex (BA 9, 10, 46, 47), the inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus, BA 40, 39) and the posterior cingulum (BA 31) were found. Thus, patients and controls did not differ in the structural processes engaged in these fundamental aspects of information processing. However, patients demonstrated significantly reduced source strength - for standard ERP components predominantly in the temporal lobe and for target components predominantly in the frontal lobe, indicating reduced energetic resources available for perceptual and cognitive demands of the discrimination task. While, as compared with placebo, estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP source strength, Climodien generally increased the impressed current density at the ERP peak latencies, predominantly in the temporal lobe, indicating an increased stimulus-induced cortical arousal in the primary and higher-order auditory cortex. Specifically, Climodien enhanced P300 source strength in the left middle temporal gyrus and in the left superior frontal gyrus, brain regions that on the one hand have been shown to be affected by hormone therapy in positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies and that on the other hand are among those critical for encoding and memory processes.

Summary: This article presents a new approach for detecting active sources in the cortex from magnetic field measurements on the scalp in magnetoencephalography (MEG). The solution of this ill-posed inverse problem is addressed within the framework of maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) principle introduced by Clarke and Janday. The main ingredient of this regularization technique is a reference probability measure on the random variables of interest. These variables are the intensity of current sources distributed on the cortical surface for which this measure encompasses all available prior information that could help to regularize the inverse problem. This measure introduces hidden Markov random variables associated with the activation state of predefined cortical regions. MEM approach is applied within this particular probabilistic framework and simulations show that the present methodology leads to a practical detection of cerebral activity from MEG data.<p>

Summary: Introduction. Cerebrovascular disease can cause different memory disorders depending on the area of the brain involved. More specifically, ischemic lesions in the frontal region can be associated to short-term verbal memory disorders. Patients and methods. Two groups of subjects were studied, 10 of whom were patients who presented a frontal cerebral infarction and 10 healthy controls. They were administered a memory task involving word recognition. While they were performing the task the electrical activity of their brains was recorded in order to examine event-related potentials (ERP). Results. The patients' performance of the task was poorer than that of the healthy control subjects. Likewise, while the latter displayed a predominantly frontal distribution of ERPs, in the patients the frontal activity diminished and was seen to be chiefly temporoparietooccipital. Conclusions. These findings allow important conclusions to be drawn about the characteristics of the memory disorder presented by these patients.<p>

Summary: Introduction. Cerebrovascular disease causes different cognitive alterations. There is a need to develop tools that are capable of diagnosing them. One of them could be event-related potentials. These provide an indicator of cognitive processing in real time. Patients and methods. A study was conducted of 10 patients with cerebral infarction in the frontal region and 10 paired healthy controls. Evaluation of the patients was performed a week after the stroke. A continuous performance test was applied to both groups together with the recording of the electrical activity in the brain in order to obtain the P300 component. The results were submitted to the non-parametric Student's t test, and the Bayesian model averaging method (BMAM) was employed to calculate the sources generating the electrical activity recorded on the electroencephalogram. Results. Patients displayed significantly poorer performances compared to the healthy controls in the attention test. The BMAM showed that the P300 component was related to the right-hand temporal structures in healthy controls, whereas the left temporoparietal regions were also involved in the patients. Conclusions. These findings indicate the existence of subclinical disorders affecting sustained attention and that they can only be detected by very sensitive tools; furthermore, they also have implications for the brain circuits regulating sustained attention and the P300 component.<p>

Summary: Magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide complementary information about the functional organization of the human brain. An important advantage of MEG/EEG is the millisecond time resolution in detecting electrical activity in the cerebral cortex. The interpretation of MEG/EEG signals, however, is limited by the difficulty of determining the spatial distribution of the neural activity. Functional MRI can help in the MEG/EEG source analysis by suggesting likely locations of activity. We present a geometric interpretation of fMRI-guided inverse solutions in which the MEG/EEG source estimate minimizes a distance to a subspace defined by the fMRI data. In this subspace regularization (SSR) approach, the fMRI bias does not assume preferred amplitudes for MEG/EEG sources, only locations. Characteristic dependence of the source estimates on the regularization parameters is illustrated with simulations. When the fMRI locations match the true MEG/EEG source locations, they serve to bias the underdetermined MEG/EEG inverse solution toward the fMRI loci. Importantly, when the fMRI loci do not match the true MEG/EEG loci, the solution is insensitive to those fMRI loci. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: We have applied a cortical imaging technique (CIT) with a three-sphere head model to estimate cortical potentials from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during interictal spikes in a pediatric epilepsy patient. The CIT analysis was performed during the ascending limb of interictal spikes and localized areas of activity were observed, overlying the epileptogenic zone, as being confirmed by the electrocorticography recordings and neurosurgical resections of the patient. The present study suggests that CIT may become a useful alternative for noninvasive localization of intracranial sources generating epileptiform activity from pre-operative scalp EEG recordings. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary: A problem of estimating biopotential sources in the brain based on EEG signals observed on the scalp is known as an important inverse problem of electrophysiology. Usually there is no closed-form solution for this problem and it requires iterative techniques such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Considering the nonlinear properties of inverse problem, and signal to noise ratio inherent in EEG signals, a back propagation neural network has been recently proposed as a solution. In this paper, we investigated the properties of neural networks and its localization accuracy for single dipole source localization. Based on the results of extensive studies, we concluded the neural networks are highly feasible in single-source localization with a small number of electrodes (18 electrodes), also examined the usefulness of this method for clinical application with a case of epilepsy.<p>

<li>White JN: Comparison of qeeg reference databases in basic signal analysis and in the evaluation of adult adhd. Journal of Neurotherapy 2003;7:123-169.<p>
Summary: Introduction. Despite the relatively widespread investigation of potential quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) characteristics of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), relatively little is known about the possible QEEG characteristics of adult ADHD. In addition to general magnitude or power measures, or ratios of these measures, the additional analyses and comparisons provided by QEEG reference databases may prove useful in providing unique markers for adult ADHD. Method. This investigation reports the findings of evaluations using three QEEG reference databases for a sample of ten adults previously diagnosed with ADHD. The packages used in the current investigation included the NeuroRep QEEG Analysis and Report System, the SKIL Topometric QEEG software package, and the NovaTech EEG EureKa3! QEEG analysis package. Results. As compared with the respective databases, adults with ADHD appear to demonstrate higher levels of 8-10 Hz activity during both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting baselines. They also appear to demonstrate frontal involvement as evidenced by hypercoherence and hypercomodulation in frontal areas. Conclusions. Each of the three QEEG reference databases appears to offer unique markers for adult ADHD. However, other apparent differences were found to be attributable to specific analysis packages rather than the clinical group itself. An investigation of basic signal analyses also revealed differences between the three packages. Results of the respective analyses and possible implications are discussed. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: While P300 current density analysis has been performed in schizophrenic patients, the event-related potential data have never been obtained using a high density recording, nor have their cortical images been well demonstrated. In this study, the auditory P300 elicited by an oddball paradigm was recorded using a high density recording system of 128 channels. Thirteen male patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were compared with 20 healthy male controls. The cortical current density analysis of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was applied to the P300 component, and this resulted in the values of 6222 current density points over the surface of a cortex model. The inter-group difference of P300 current density was assessed using a point-by-point comparison by t-test. While the normal controls demonstrated the cortical activation of bilateral frontal, temporal and parietal cortex during the oddball paradigm, visual inspection suggested that in the schizophrenic patients these areas were less activated. The inter-group significance of P300 current density was dominant over the left hemisphere, and particularly over the left prefrontal area. It is concluded that the LORETA current density analysis localizes the neural activity from the cortical fronto-temporo-parietal network as the neural substrates of the scalp recorded P300. The dysfunction of such a network, especially over the left hemisphere, possibly subserves the scalp recorded P300 abnormality in schizophrenia. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary: Functional imaging of brain electrical activity was performed in 25 chronic medicated schizophrenics and 40 controls, analyzing the classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) of 19-channel EEG during resting state to identify brain regions with deviant activity of different functional significances, using LORETA (Low Resolution Tomography) and SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping). Patients differed from controls due to an excess of slow activity comprising delta + theta frequency bands (inhibitory pattern) located at the right middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right insula, as well as at the bilateral anterior cingulum with a left preponderance. The high temporal resolution of EEG enables the specification of the deviations not only as an excess or a deficit of brain electrical activity, but also as inhibitory (delta, theta), normal (alpha), and excitatory (beta) activities. These deviations point out to an impaired functional brain state consisting of inhibited frontal and prefrontal areas that may result in inadequate treatment of externally or internally generated information.<p>

Summary: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the profile of cognitive impairment in patients with cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA) by measurement of event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests. We studied 13 CCA patients and 13 age-, sex- and education-matched normal controls. For ERP recording, we used the conventional auditory oddball task as well as the continuous performance task, which evaluates the attentional performance and ability to control a motor response, i.e., to execute ('Go') or inhibit a motor reaction ('No Go'). Brain electric activity was recorded using 20 scalp electrodes and computed into series of potential distribution maps. For components of ERP, reference-independent measures [global field power (GFP)] were determined, and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute the three-dimensional intracerebral distribution of electric activity of the P3 component of Go and No Go responses. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was also assessed. GFP peak latency was prolonged and GFP peak was attenuated under the No Go condition in patients with CCA, although there were no differences in the auditory oddball task and in the Go condition between the two groups. LORETA showed low activation of frontal source in CCA patients in No Go P3 compared with the controls. However, neuropsychological tests revealed no differences between the two groups. Our results indicate that degeneration of the cerebellum contributes to frontal dysfunction, and suggest this dysfunction is characterized by an impairment of the inhibitory system.

Summary: In this paper, we consider the biomagnetic inverse problem of estimating a time-varying source current from magnetic field measurements. It is assumed that the data are severely corrupted by measurement noise. This setting is a model for magnetoencephalography (MEG) when the dynamic nature of the source prevents us from effecting noise reduction by averaging over consecutive measurements. Thus, the potential applications of this approach include the single trial estimation of the brain activity, in particular from the spontaneous MEG data. Our approach is based on non-stationary Bayesian estimation, and we propose the use of particle filters. The source model in this work is either a single dipole or multiple dipole model. Part of the problem consists of the model determination. Numerical simulations are presented.<p>

Summary: Mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to investigate the processing of the discrimination between native and non-native CV syllables in tonal languages. MMN elicited by the native word was greater than that elicited by the non-native word. Hearing a native-language deviant significantly altered the elicited MMN in both amplitude and scalp voltage field distribution, reflecting the presence of a long-term memory trace for spoken words in tonal languages.<p>

<li>Sinai A, Pratt H: High-resolution time course of hemispheric dominance revealed by low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. Clinical Neurophysiology 2003;114:1181-1188.<p>
Summary: Objective: Auditory event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a lexical decision task in response to linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli, to assess the detailed time course of language processing in general, and hemispheric dominance in particular. Methods: Young adults (n=17) were presented with pairs of auditory stimuli consisting of words, pseudowords and words played backwards in a lexical decision task. ERPs were recorded from 21 scalp electrodes. Current densities were calculated using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Statistic non-parametric maps of activity were derived from the calculated current densities and the number of active brain voxels in the left and right hemispheres was compared throughout the processing of each stimulus. Results: Our results show that hemispheric dominance is highly time dependent, alternating between the right and left hemispheres at different times, and that the right hemisphere's role in language processing follows a different time course for first and second language. The time course of hemispheric dominance for non-linguistic stimuli was highly variable. Conclusions: The time course of hemispheric dominance is dynamic, alternating between left and right homologous regions, with different time courses for different stimulus classes. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Objective: Our primary aim in the present study was to establish the anatomic and psychophysiological correlates of automatic and controlled semantic priming. Methods: Current sources were calculated on N400 component data from a previous study on lexical decision tasks [Clin Neurophysiol 1999;110:813] using the variable resolution electromagnetic tomography method (VARETA). In this study, two experiments were carried out, one using directly related pairs and the other one using mediated related pairs. Each experiment consisted of 3 tasks that required different levels of contribution from controlled processes. Results: Average source localization images showed the brain structures involved in lexical decision tasks. The automatic component of the N400 effect was related to activation of occipitotemporal and parahippocampal gyri and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. The expectancy strategy was related to activation of the right posterior temporal and right frontal areas. The postlexical strategy was associated with activation of right frontal, anterior cingulate and bilateral superior parietal areas. Conclusions: The findings indicated that the current sources of the N400 varied according to the relative contributions of automatic and controlled mechanisms. Moreover, the sources of the N400 effect depended on the type of strategy used. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Ricamato AL, Dhaher YY, Dewald JPA: Estimation of active cortical current source regions using a vector representation scanning approach. Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology 2003;20:326-344.<p>
Summary: The objective of this article is to present a framework for cortical current source reconstruction that extracts a center and magnitude of electrical brain activity from EEG signals. High-resolution EEG recordings, a subject-specific MRI-based electromagnetic boundary element method (BEM) model, and a channel reduction technique are used. This new geometric measure combines the magnitude and spatial location of electrical brain activity of each of the identified subsets of channels into a three-dimensional resultant vector. The combination of the two approaches constitutes a source reconstruction scanning technique that provides a real-time estimation of cortical centers that can be tracked over time. Simulations demonstrate that the ability of this method to find the best-fit cortical location is more robust both in terms of accuracy and precision than traditional approaches for single-source conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates its ability to localize and separate cortical activity in plausible sites for two different motor tasks. Finally, this method provides a statistical measure to compare electrical brain activity associated with different motor tasks.<p>

Summary: In rodents, theta rhythm has been linked to the hippocampal formation, as well as other regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). To test the role of the ACC in theta rhythm, concurrent measurements of brain electrical activity (EEG) and glucose metabolism (PET) were performed in 29 subjects at baseline. EEG data were analyzed with a source localization technique that enabled voxelwise correlations of EEG and PET data. For theta, but not other bands, the rostral ACC (Brodmann areas 24/32) was the largest cluster with positive correlations between current density and glucose metabolism. Positive correlations were also found in right fronto-temporal regions. In control but not depressed subjects, theta within ACC and prefrontal/orbitofrontal regions was positively correlated. The results reveal a link between theta and cerebral metabolism in the ACC as well as disruption of functional connectivity within frontocingulate pathways in depression.<p>

Summary: Social cognition, including complex social judgments and attitudes, is shaped by individual learning experiences, where affect often plays a critical role. Aversive classical conditioning - a form of associative learning involving a relationship between a neutral event (conditioned stimulus, CS) and an aversive event (unconditioned stimulus, US) - represents a well-controlled paradigm to study how the acquisition of socially relevant knowledge influences behavior and the brain. Unraveling the temporal unfolding of brain mechanisms involved appears critical for an initial understanding about how social cognition operates. Here, 128-channel ERPs were recorded in 50 subjects during the acquisition phase of a differential aversive classical conditioning paradigm. The CS+ (two fearful faces) were paired 50% of the time with an aversive noise (CS? + /Paired), whereas in the remaining 50% they were not (CS? + /Unpaired); the CS- (two different fearful faces) were never paired with the noise. Scalp ERP analyses revealed differences between CS? + /Unpaired and CS- as early as ?120ms post-stimulus. Tomographic source localization analyses revealed early activation modulated by the CS+ in the ventral visual pathway (e.g. fusiform gyrus, ?120ms), right middle frontal gyrus (?176ms), and precuneus (?240ms). At ?120ms, the CS- elicited increased activation in the left insula and left middle frontal gyrus. These findings not only confirm a critical role of prefrontal, insular, and precuneus regions in aversive conditioning, but they also suggest that biologically and socially salient information modulates activation at early stages of the information processing flow, and thus furnish initial insight about how affect and social judgments operate. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Summary: Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) reflect power changes at the stimulus driving frequency and have been used to assess brain activity reflecting cognitive processing. Only one study has demonstrated SSVEP modulation associated with working memory (WM), and none have compared the spatial localization of SSVEP modulations during WM performance with other brain imaging methods. Here we examined WM-related activity recorded with dense-array SSVEPs, analyzed using low resolution electromagnetic tomography, and compared the results to our previous findings using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). WM was associated with increased SSVEP activity over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, paralleling our previous fMRI findings. Frontal WM-related SSVEP power correlated selectively with task performance. These results demonstrate the utility of SSVEPs for studying representational aspects of cognition. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: We investigated the characteristics of P300 generators in schizophrenics by using voxel-based statistical parametric mapping of current density images. P300 generators, produced by a rare target tone of 1500 Hz (15%) under a frequent nontarget tone of 1000 Hz (85%), were measured in 20 right-handed schizophrenics and 21 controls. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), using a realistic head model of the boundary element method based on individual MRI, was applied to the 128-channel EEG. Three-dimensional current density images were reconstructed from the LORETA intensity maps that covered the whole cortical gray matter. Spatial normalization and intensity normalization of the smoothed current density images were used to reduce anatomical variance and subject-specific global activity and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied for the statistical analysis. We found that the sources of P300 were consistently localized at the left superior parietal area in normal subjects, while those of schizophrenics were diversely distributed. Upon statistical comparison, schizophrenics, with globally reduced current densities, showed a significant P300 current density reduction in the left medial temporal area and in the left inferior parietal area, while both left prefrontal and right orbitofrontal areas were relatively activated. The left parietotemporal area was found to correlate negatively with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores of schizophrenic patients. In conclusion, the reduced and increased areas of current density in schizophrenic patients suggest that the medial temporal and frontal areas contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the frontotemporal circuitry abnormality. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Nixon JB, Rasser PE, Teubner MD, Clark CR, Bottema MJ: Numerical model of electrical potential within the human head. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 2003;56:2353-2366.<p>
Summary: A realistic subject-specific human head model was constructed based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Electrical conductivities were assigned inhomogeneously according to tissue type and variability within each head segment. A three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference method (FDM) was used to compute the evolution of the electrical potential from a single electrical dipole within the brain. The Douglas-Rachford FDM and three versions of iterative FDM were tested on a three-layer concentric sphere model. The successive over-relaxation (SOR) iterative method showed the best convergence properties and hence was used to compute the electrical potential within a realistic head model. The effect of using inhomogeneous rather than homogeneous conductivities within head segments of this model was shown to be important. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.<p>

<li>Maurer U, Bucher K, Brem S, Brandeis D: Development of the automatic mismatch response: From frontal positivity in kindergarten children to the mismatch negativity. Clinical Neurophysiology 2003;114:808-817.<p>
Summary: Objective: The automatic event-related potential (ERP) response to auditory deviance typically consists of a frontocentral mismatch negativity (MMN), which has been shown to be quite stable during development. Whereas in some infant studies, positive frontal mismatch responses have been reported instead of a MMN; to date, such positivities have not been reported for older children. Methods: Oddball sequences with small frequency and phoneme deviance (standard: 1000Hz, 'ba'; larger deviance: 1060Hz, 'ta'; smaller deviance: 1030Hz, 'da') and short intervals (every 0.38s) were presented to 6-7-year-old children and adults during 43-channel ERP recordings. Results: Children showed a consistent frontal positive mismatch response with posterior negativity (179-207ms), and adults a frontocentral MMN with mastoid positivity (129-199ms). This map polarity reversal was reflected by significantly different 3D centroid distributions. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed temporal mismatch response sources for both age groups and conditions. Conclusions: Major developmental changes characterise the automatic mismatch response for the small deviances and short intervals used. Source localisation suggests that children's and adults' mismatch responses originated from superior temporal plane generators with similar localisation but opposite polarity. This indicates qualitatively different neurophysiological functioning of the automatic bi-temporal auditory change detectors in children and adults. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: In this study we compared the current density power and power asymmetry in 15 right-handed, medication-free chronically depressed females (of the unipolar type) and age-matched non-clinical female controls. We used frequency domain LORETA (Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography). In the interhemispheric asymmetry analysis, compared with the control group, the depression group exhibited a left-to-right Alpha2 (10-12 Hz) current density dominance in the left postcentral gyrus. The pattern of left-to-right dominance included frontal (especially medial and middle frontal gyri) and temporal locations. The between groups comparison of spectral power revealed decreased activity in the right middle temporal gyrus in the depressed group. The decrease emerged in the whole frequency spectrum analyzed (2-32 Hz), although it reached significance in the Delta (2-3.5 Hz) band only. These findings are discussed in terms of the existing literature on affect using EEG, PET and SPECT. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Two words that varied in their relationship were presented sequentially to Chinese readers who made meaning and pronunciation decisions. In the meaning task, they decided whether the words had the same meaning. In the pronunciation task, they decided whether the words had the same pronunciation. In both tasks, the word pairs represented 1 of 4 relationships: graphically similar, homophonic, semantically related, or unrelated. Event related potentials (ERP) recordings made from the onset of the 2nd word suggested a temporal unfolding of graphic, phonological, and semantic effects. Specifically, graphically related pairs produced a smaller P200 in the pronunciation task and a smaller N400 in the meaning task. Homophones produced reduced N400 component with bilateral sources in the meaning task.<p>

<li>Liu Y, Perfetti CA: The time course of brain activity in reading english and chinese: An erp study of chinese bilinguals. Human Brain Mapping 2003;18:167-175.<p>
Summary: Chinese bilinguals performed a delayed naming task, reading both Chinese characters and English words, while EEGs were recorded by a 128-channel system. Principle component analysis (PCA) of Event Related Potentials (ERP) from the onset of the stimulus suggested a temporal unfolding of graphic, phonological, and semantic processing that depended on both language and word frequency. At 150 msec, Chinese produced an earlier and higher amplitude shift (N150) than English. At 250 msec, frequency effects were significant for both Chinese and English, but at 450 msec, only the English frequency effect was reliable. Source localization analysis by Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) showed bilateral occipital (left BA 17, right BA 18) visual processing of Chinese characters with left occipital only (left BA 17) for English high-frequency words. Low-frequency English words showed activation bilaterally, but with a more diffused and extended temporal pattern. Right prefrontal area (BA 10) was found to be strongly activated in the mid latency (300-400 msec) period of Chinese character naming, whereas English word naming showed more medial frontal (BA 8, and 10) activation. A post 450-msec visual verification was found to be general for both writing systems. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Objective: The purpose of this study was to define and analyze the brain activity associated with fusion of speech elements to form an auditory object and to study the effects of presenting the elements at different spatial locations (duplex stimulus). Methods: Stimuli were formant transitions (presented to the front, left or right of the subject) and base (presented to the front), that fused to result in V-C-V sequences /aga/ and /ada/. Ten right-handed, adult, native Hebrew speakers discriminated each fused stimulus, and the brain potentials associated with performance of the task were recorded from 21 electrodes. The net-fusion response, the 'F(fusion)-complex', was extracted by subtracting the sum of potentials to the base and formant transitions from the potentials to the fused sound. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) was performed to assess the timing and brain location of the fusion process. Results: The 'F-complex', comprising of the difference N1, P2, N2b (FN1, FP2, FN2b) components could be identified for each of the stimuli and reflected a process indicating inhibition, occlusion or both, with right ear advantage in fusion. LORETA analyses indicate sequential processing of speech fusion in the temporal lobes, beginning with right prominence in FN1 and FP2 shifting to a more symmetrical pattern in FN2. Conclusions: The electrophysiological correlates of speech fusion highlight the uniqueness of speech perception and the brain areas involved in its analysis. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the processing of auditory movement sensation accompanying duplex perception in binaural hearing. Methods: Stimuli were formant transitions (presented to the front, left or right of the subject) and base (presented to the front), that fused to result in vowel-consonant-vowel (V-C-V) sequences /aga/ and /ada/. An illusion of auditory movement (duplex sensation) accompanied the fusion of these V-C-V sequences when the spatial locations of the formant transitions and base were different. Ten right-handed, adult, native Hebrew speakers discriminated each fused stimulus, and the brain potentials associated with performance of the task were recorded from 21 electrodes. The processing of auditory movement was studied by a factorial design (ANOVA) and statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM) of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) images of the net-fusion response. Brain regions implicated in auditory movement processing were expected to be associated with the lateralized formant location, which gave rise to duplex perception. In addition, the time-course of significant activation in brain areas that differentiated between fusion conditions was determined. Results: The posterior parietal, anterior cingulate and premotor cortices were found to be implicated in duplex processing. Auditory cortex involvement was also evident, and together with the latter two brain regions was affected by right-ear advantage. Conclusions: Duplex perception resulting from fusion of spatially separate sounds forming an auditory object results in activation of a network of brain regions reflecting enhanced allocation of attention and the effect of language processing. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: A new procedure to model extended cortical sources from EEG and MEG recordings based on a probabilistic approach is presented. The method (SPMECS) was implemented within the framework of maximum likelihood estimators. Neuronal activity generating EEG or MEG signals was characterized by the number of sources and their location and extension. Based on the noise distribution of the measured data, source configurations were associated with the according value of the likelihood function. To find the most likely source, i.e., the maximum likelihood estimator, and its level of confidence, a stochastic solver (Metropolis algorithm) was applied. The method presented supports the incorporation of virtually any constraint, e.g., based on physiological and anatomical a priori knowledge. Thus, ambiguity of the ill-posed inverse problem was reduced considerably by confining sources to the cortical surface extracted from individual MR images. The influence of different levels and types of noise on the outcome was investigated by means of simulations. Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields analyzed by the method presented suggest that larger extended cortical areas are involved in the processing of combined finger stimulation as compared to single finger stimulation. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Im CH, An KO, Jung HK, Kwon H, Lee YH: Assessment criteria for meg/eeg cortical patch tests. Physics in Medicine and Biology 2003;48:2561-2573.<p>
Summary: To validate newly developed methods or implemented software for magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) source localization problems, many researchers have used human skull phantom experiments or artificially constructed forward data sets. Between the two methods, the use of an artificial data set constructed with forward calculation attains superiority over the use of a human skull phantom in that it is simple to implement, adjust and control various conditions. Nowadays, for the forward calculation, especially for the cortically distributed source models, generating artificial activation patches on a brain cortical surface has been popularized instead of activating some point dipole sources. However, no well-established assessment criterion to validate the reconstructed results quantitatively has yet been introduced. In this paper, we suggest some assessment criteria to compare and validate the various MEG/EEG source localization techniques or implemented software applied to the cortically distributed source model. Four different criteria can be used to measure accuracy, degrees of focalization, noise-robustness, existence of spurious sources and so on. To verify the usefulness of the proposed criteria, four different results from two different noise conditions and two different reconstruction techniques were compared for several patches. The simulated results show that the new criteria can provide us with a reliable index to validate the MEG/EEG source localization techniques.<p>

<li>Hori J, He B: Eeg cortical potential imaging of brain electrical activity by means of parametric projection filters. IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems 2003;E86-D:1909-1920.<p>
Summary: The objective of this study was to explore suitable spatial filters for inverse estimation of cortical potentials from the scalp electroencephalogram. The effect of incorporating noise covariance into inverse procedures was examined by computer simulations. The parametric projection filter, which allows inverse estimation with the presence of information on the noise covariance, was applied to an inhomogeneous three-concentric-sphere model under various noise conditions in order to estimate the cortical potentials from the scalp potentials. The present simulation results suggest that incorporation of information on the noise covariance allows better estimation of cortical potentials, than inverse solutions without knowledge about the noise covariance, when the correlation between the signal and noise is low. The method for determining the optimum regularization parameter, which can be applied for parametric inverse techniques, is also discussed.<p>

<li>Holliday IE, Barnes GR, Hillebrand A, Singh KD: Accuracy and applications of group meg studies using cortical source locations estimated from participants' scalp surfaces. Human Brain Mapping 2003;20:142-147.<p>
Summary: We contend that powerful group studies can be conducted using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which can provide useful insights into the approximate distribution of the neural activity detected with MEG without requiring magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for each participant. Instead, a participant's MRI is approximated with one chosen as a best match on the basis of the scalp surface from a database of available MRIs. Because large inter-individual variability in sulcal and gyral patterns is an inherent source of blurring in studies using grouped functional activity, the additional error introduced by this approximation procedure has little effect on the group results, and offers a sufficiently close approximation to that of the participants to yield a good indication of the true distribution of the grouped neural activity. T1-weighted MRIs of 28 adults were acquired in a variety of MR systems. An artificial functional image was prepared for each person in which eight 5 × 5 × 5 mm regions of brain activation were simulated. Spatial normalisation was applied to each image using transformations calculated using SPM99 with (1) the participant's actual MRI, and (2) the best matched MRI substituted from those of the other 27 participants. The distribution of distances between the locations of points using real and substituted MRIs had a modal value of 6 mm with 90% of cases falling below 12.5 mm. The effects of this -approach on real grouped SAM source imaging of MEG data in a verbal fluency task are also shown. The distribution of MEG activity in the estimated average response is very similar to that produced when using the real MRIs. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Halford JJ: Neurophysiologic correlates of psychiatric disorders and potential applications in epilepsy. Epilepsy and Behavior 2003;4:375-385.<p>
Summary: There is increasing interest in psychiatric assessment using neurophysiologic tools such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This is because these technologies have good temporal resolution, are relatively noninvasive, and (with the exception of MEG) are economical. Many different experimental paradigms and analysis techniques for the assessment of psychiatric patients involving these technologies are reviewed including conventional quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG), EEG cordance, low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), frontal midline theta, midlatency auditory evoked potentials (P50, N100, P300), loudness dependency of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), mismatch negativity (MMN), contingent negative variation (CNV), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Many of these neurophysiologic stimulus paradigms hold the promise of improving psychiatric patient care by improving diagnostic precision, predicting treatment response, and providing new phenotypes for genetic studies. Large cooperative multisite studies need to be designed to test and validate a few of these paradigms so that they might find use in routine clinical practice. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

<li>Go?mez CM, Marco J, Grau C: Preparatory visuo-motor cortical network of the contingent negative variation estimated by current density. NeuroImage 2003;20:216-224.<p>
Summary: The present report studied the intracerebral current density of the contingent negative variation (CNV) during a visuo-manual task using the gap paradigm. The CNV is usually obtained during preparatory periods for perception and action. In this experiment right-hand responses were required. The CNV potential was obtained during the preparatory period from electrodes placed at 58 scalp sites. The CNV showed an early and a late phase. Scalp voltage and source current density maps showed that the early phase was focused on frontal midline sites. The late phase had two foci, one overlying the primary motor cortex and one over occipital sites. When analyzed by low-resolution tomography, the early phase of the CNV showed activations in the supplementary motor area (SMA), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and some posterior areas. The late phase had anterior activations in the left prefrontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, primary motor cortex, ACC, and SMA; and several posterior activations including those in the medial occipital cortex, middle inferior occipital cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal and parietal areas. Results from the activated areas and their temporal dynamics during the preparatory period suggest that the ACC and the SMA areas recruit the action- and perception-related areas needed to process the expected subsequent imperative task. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

<li>Fallgatter AJ, Bartsch AJ, Zielasek J, Herrmann MJ: Brain electrical dysfunction of the anterior cingulate in schizophrenic patients. Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging 2003;124:37-48.<p>
Summary: The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key region within the human prefrontal cortex that has been shown to be dysfunctional in schizophrenic patients. Supporting evidence for this notion has been collected with neuroimaging methods during various cognitive activation tasks. Recently, electrophysiological ACC activity has been demonstrated by means of a three-dimensional source location with low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) in the event-related potentials elicited during the NoGo condition of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) as compared to its Go condition. Thirty-one schizophrenic patients and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were investigated with this newly developed electrophysiological method. LORETA analysis revealed a significantly diminished brain electrical activity in the ACC of schizophrenic patients as compared to controls during the NoGo condition of the CPT. This result supports the assumption of a functional deficit of the ACC during this cognitive task as a central feature in schizophrenias and, thereby, specifies the general concept of hypofrontality. Moreover, this investigation underscores the value of sophisticated electrophysiological methods in combination with unambiguously designed mental tasks for the evaluation of the pathophysiological processes underlying schizophrenic diseases. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<li>Coutin-Churchman P, De Freytez AP: Vector analysis of visual evoked potentials in migraineurs with visual aura. Clinical Neurophysiology 2003;114:2132-2137.<p>
Summary: Objective: To assess the capability of vector analysis of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for revealing alterations in posterior visual pathways in migraineurs with visual aura. Methods: VEPs to pattern reversal (PR) and LED goggle stimulation were obtained in 23 patients suffering from migraine with visual aura, in an orthogonal Fpz-Oz and T3-T4 montage and displayed as a two-channel Lissajous' trajectory. VEP latency and amplitude at Fpz-Oz, bc segment amplitude (V) and bc vector orientation angle (?) were compared with a previously collected normative database for individual assessment, and group comparisons with the previously collected normal sample were made. Electrophysiological measures were also correlated with time from onset of disease and from the last crisis, and with the side of symptoms. Results: No individual alterations in VEP latency or amplitude were observed. However, 36. 4% of patients showed alterations in vector orientation to PR and 78% to LED goggles. Group differences with respect to normal subjects were found not only in vector orientation but also in midline VEP and V, only for PR stimulation. A significant relationship was found between the laterality of vector deviation and the laterality of symptoms. Conclusions: Vector analysis of VEP revealed alterations possibly corresponding to asymmetrical visual cortex activation in migraineurs with visual aura, mainly to diffuse light stimulation. Significance: An electrophysiological parameter of individual value for revealing asymmetric activation of visual cortex in migraineurs is proposed. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Objective: To evaluate the incidence, sensitivity and specificity of abnormal quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures in normal subjects and patients with mental disorders. Methods: Normalized QEEG measures were blindly assessed in 67 normal human beings and 340 psychiatric patients. QEEG results were correlated to subject condition or diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Results: QEEG was abnormal in 83% of patients, and 12% of normal subjects. The most frequent abnormality was a decrease in slow (delta and/or theta) bands, either alone, with beta increase, or with alpha decrease, followed by increase in beta band. No normal subject showed delta and/or theta decrease. Slow band decrease was more frequent in depression and mental disorders due to general medical condition, alcohol and drug dependence. However, no pattern was specific of any entity, and patients within the same diagnostic may present different patterns. Delta-theta decrease was correlated with cortical atrophy as seen in MRI. Beta increase was correlated with psychoactive medication. No association was found between any other QEEG pattern and MRI abnormalities, or medication. Conclusions: Decrease in the delta and theta bands of the QEEG can be regarded as a specific sign of brain dysfunction, and is correlated with cortical atrophy. However, this sign, as other QEEG abnormal patterns, can be found in many different disorders and none of them can be considered as pathognomonic of any specific disorder. Significance: This work attempted to circumvent the alleged lack of Class I evidence of QEEG utility in the study of psychiatric patients by means of a prospective, blinded study, searching for specific signs of physiopathology in individual patients. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

<li>Congedo M, Lubar JF: Parametric and non-parametric analysis of qeeg: Normative database comparisons in electroencephalography, a simulation study on accuracy. Journal of Neurotherapy 2003;7:1-29.<p>
Summary: Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) as a tool for the diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric disorders is receiving increased interest. While QEEG analysis is restricted to the scalp, the recent development of electromagnetic tomography (ET) allows the study of the electrical activity of all cortical structures. Electrical measures from a patient can be compared with a normative database derived from a large sample of healthy individuals. The deviance from the database norms provides a measure of the likelihood that the patient's electrical activity reflects abnormal brain functioning. The focus of this article is a method for estimating such deviance. The traditional method based on z-scores (parametric) is reviewed and a new method based on percentiles (non-parametric) is proposed. The parametric and the non-parametric methods are compared using simulated data. The accuracy of both methods is assessed as a function of normative sample size and gaussianity for three different alpha levels. Results suggest that the performance of the parametric method is unaffected by sample size, given that the sample size is large enough (N &gt; 100), but that non-gaussianity jeopardizes accuracy even if the normative distribution is close to gaussianity. In contrast, the performance of the non-parametric method is unaffected by non-gaussianity, but is a function of sample size only. It is shown that with N &gt; 160, the non-parametric method is always preferable. Results will be discussed taking into consideration technical issues related to the nature of QEEG and ET data. It will be suggested that the sample size is the only constant across EEG frequency bands, measurement locations, and kind of quantitative measures. As a consequence, for a given database, the error rate of the non-parametric database is homogeneous; however, the same is not true for the parametric method. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Summary: Objective: To investigate a modulation of the N170 face-sensitive component related to the perception of other-race (OR) and same-race (SR) faces, as well as differences in face and non-face object processing, by combining different methods of event-related potential (ERP) signal analysis. Methods: Sixty-two channel ERPs were recorded in 12 Caucasian subjects presented with Caucasian and Asian faces along with non-face objects. Surface data were submitted to classical waveforms and ERP map topography analysis. Underlying brain sources were estimated with two inverse solutions (BESA and LORETA). Results: The N170 face component was identical for both race faces. This component and its topography revealed a face specific pattern regardless of race. However, in this time period OR faces evoked significantly stronger medial occipital activity than SR faces. Moreover, in terms of maps, at around 170 ms face-specific activity significantly preceded non-face object activity by 25 ms. These ERP maps were followed by similar activation patterns across conditions around 190-300 ms, most likely reflecting the activation of visually derived semantic information. Conclusions: The N170 was not sensitive to the race of the faces. However, a possible pre-attentive process associated to the relatively stronger unfamiliarity for OR faces was found in medial occipital area. Moreover, our data provide further information on the time-course of face and non-face object processing. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Dysfunctions of the hippocampus have been suggested to be related to schizophrenia, and reduced connectivity with other brain regions may be a key for the pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of white matter anomalies in the hippocampus, as a sign of altered connectivity, on the brain electrical activity. We investigated seven first episode schizophrenic patients and seven age, gender and education-matched controls with diffusion tensor imaging and resting EEG. Fractional anisotropy was computed based on diffusion tensor imaging data for the right and left hippocampus for both groups. No group differences were found in hippocampal fractional anisotropy, EEG spectral power and topography. However a significant correlation was found between more anterior ? activity and lower fractional anisotropy of both hippocampi in schizophrenics, but not in controls. More anterior ? activity has been described in schizophrenia. We conclude that this feature might depict a group of schizophrenic patients with reduced hippocampal connectivity. © 2003 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

<li>Bauer H, Pripfl J, Lamm C, Prainsack C, Taylor N: Functional neuroanatomy of learned helplessness. NeuroImage 2003;20:927-939.<p>
Summary: In the experiments reported here, female subjects were presented with reasoning tasks that changed from solvable to unsolvable, evoking &quot;learned helplessness&quot; or &quot;loss of control&quot; reactions in some subjects. Significant differences in slow cortical potential (SCP) changes were found between emotionally highly and lowly reactive subjects (grouped according to responses in postexperimental questionnaires) when processing unsolvable tasks. Cortical LORETA (Pascual-Marqui, 1999) of SCP topographies (Bauer, 1998; Bauer et al., 2000) and subsequent statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM; Nichols and Holmes, 2002) analysis indicate clear reduction of anterior cingulate activity only with emotionally highly reactive subjects. In these subjects a region of the brain that is indispensable for goal-directed handling of tasks was switched off, whereas regions that are primarily engaged in processing the task stimuli were even more active during loss of control, although not at a statistically significant level. According to Carter et al. (1999) the anterior cingulate monitors the conflicts among brain regions and issues calls for further processing to the PFC that then guides behavior toward a goal. Learned helplessness might then be seen a state in which the function of the anterior cingulate is no longer maintained, perhaps due to the inhibitory influence of the amygdala possibly mediated via the brainstem dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (Davis et al., 1994; Goldstein et al., 1996). © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Summary: Objective: To assess the relationship between cerebellum and brain cortical activity without motor factors, we recorded the mid-latency auditory evoked responses (MLRs) with simultaneous recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) at rest in patients with 'pure cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA)'. Methods: We studied 12 normal control subjects and non-demented 'pure CCA' patients determined by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging analysis. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery assessed intelligence, frontal lobe function and word fluency. Spontaneous eyes-closed resting EEG and MLRs were recorded from 20 scalp electrodes and analysed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to compute the 3-dimensional intracerebral distribution of electric activity. Results: Neuropsychological tests revealed no differences between CCA and the control. Analysis of EEG and MLRs using classical methods also did not reveal any differences. LORETA analysis indicated significant decrease of alpha2 activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CCA. On MLRs, the most significant difference was observed at P1 component, and CCA patients showed significant decrease at the right superior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the frontal lobe and ascending reticular activating system are inhibited in CCA patients, and suggested the involvement of the cerebellum in cortical electric activities irrespective of motor adjunct. Significance: Quantitative EEG and MLR measurements with LORETA pointed out frontal lobe hypoactivities in pure CCA patients. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Summary: Cognitive event-related potentials were recorded from 17 EEG leads in an auditory two-tone paradigm in 43 patients aged 51-79 years with the diagnosis of age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), in age-and sex-matched normal controls and in a control group 10 years older than the AAMI patients. In addition to P300 latencies, amplitudes and topographies, three-dimensional current density distribution utilizing low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was computed. P300 latency was delayed and P300 amplitude was reduced in both AAMI and older subjects. Topographically this amplitude reduction was most pronounced frontally. LORETA revealed medial (frontal and parietal) and lateral (dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal, middle/superior temporal, posterior superior temporal/inferior parietal) sources. Significant reductions in LORETA source strength in normal aging and in AAMI were found mainly medially frontally, right dorsolaterally prefrontally and right inferiorly parietally. Since these anatomically highly interconnected brain regions in the right hemisphere are part of a network associated with sustained attention, the results speak for a decline in attentional resource capacity in AAMI patients and elderly subjects. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Chinese Journal of Biomedical Engineering 2002;21Summary: By using computer simulation, effectiveness of multiple signal classification (MUSIC) was evaluated. The head model used was the concentric 3-spheres conductor model. The EEG time-course was reconstructed by the Total Least Squares (TLS). Two new parameters were proposed: Normalized Blurring Index (NBI) was used to indicate the spatial blurring level and Singular Value Ratio (SVR) was used to show the effectiveness of the signal-noise subspace decomposition in the MUSIC algorithm. The general Relative Error (RE) and Correlation Coefficient (CC) were used to express the temporal reconstruction precision. It was simulated by using the different level of Gaussian white noise and the different correlation sources that the spatial blurring seriousness, the temporal reconstruction precision and the ability to decompose the signal and the noise subspace of the MUSIC algorithm. The results showed that the MUSIC algorithm was robust to the Gaussian white noise and sensitive to the sources correlation.<p>

Summary: Combining event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may provide sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to clarify the functional connectivity of neural processes, provided both methods represent the same neural networks. The current study investigates the statistical correspondence of ERP tomography and fMRI within the common activity volume and time range in a complex visual language task. The results demonstrate that both methods represent similar neural networks within the bilateral occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, precuneus and middle frontal gyrus, and the left inferior and superior parietal lobe, middle and superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. The mean correspondence of both methods over subjects was significant. On an individual basis, only half of the subjects showed significantly corresponding activity patterns, suggesting that a one-to-one correspondence between individual fMRI activation patterns and ERP source tomographies integrated over microstates cannot be assumed in all cases. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Clinically well-defined diagnostic subgroups of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia with predominantly plus and minus symptomatology, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, multiinfarct dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and alcohol dependence, show electroencephalogram (EEG) maps that differ statistically both from each other and from normal controls. Representative drugs of the main psychopharmacological classes, such as sedative and nonsedative neuroleptics and antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, psychostimulants and cognition-enhancing drugs, induce significant and typical changes to normal human brain function compared with placebo, in which many variables are opposite to the above-mentioned differences between psychiatric patients and normal controls. Thus, by considering these differences between psychotropic drugs and placebo in normal subjects, as well as between mental disorder patients and normal controls, it may be possible to choose the optimum drug for a specific patient according to a key-lock principle, since the drug should normalize the deviant brain function. This is supported by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), which identifies brain regions affected by psychiatric disorders and psychotropic drugs. © 2002 Prous Science.

Summary: Utilizing computer-assisted quantitative analyses of human scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with certain statistical procedures (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) and mapping techniques (pharmaco-EEG mapping), it is possible to classify psychotropic substances and objectively evaluate their bioavailability at the target organ: the human brain. Specifically, one may determine at an early stage of drug development whether a drug is effective on the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo, what its clinical efficacy will be like, at which dosage it acts, when it acts and the equipotent dosages of different galenic formulations. Pharmaco-EEG profiles and maps of neuroleptics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, psychostimulants and nootropics/cognition-enhancing drugs will be described in this paper. Methodological problems, as well as the relationships between acute and chronic drug effects, alterations in normal subjects and patients, CNS effects, therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be discussed. In recent times, imaging of drug effects on the regional brain electrical activity of healthy subjects by means of EEG tomography such as low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been used for identifying brain areas predominantly involved in psychopharmacological action. This will be demonstrated for the representative drugs of the four main psychopharmacological classes, such as 3 mg haloperidol for neuroleptics, 20 mg citalopram for antidepressants, 2 mg lorazepam for tranquilizers and 20 mg methylphenidate for psychostimulants. LORETA demonstrates that these psychopharmacological classes effect brain structures differently. © 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.<p>

Journal of Neural Transmission 2002;109:1505-1526.<p>
Summary: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, the acute and subacute effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), or ademetionine, on brain function and behavior of 10 elderly normal healthy volunteers (5 males and 5 females, aged 56-71 years, mean: 59.3 years) were investigated by means of EEG mapping and psychometry. In random order they received infusions of 800mg SAMe and placebo, administered over 30 minutes for 7 days, with a wash-out period of 3 weeks in between. EEG recordings and psychometric tests were carried out 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours after drug administration on days 1 and 7. Multivariate analysis based on MANOVA/Hotelling T2 tests demonstrated significant central effects of SAMe as compared with placebo after acute, subacute and superimposed drug administration. Acute SAMe-induced changes were characterized by a decrease in total power, an increase in absolute delta and a decrease in absolute alpha power, further by an increase in relative delta and a decrease in relative alpha power, a slowing of the delta/theta centroid as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total power spectrum. These changes are typical of classical antidepressants of the thymoleptic type such as imipramine and amitriptyline. After one week of daily infusions there was a marked increase in total power, reminiscent of nootropic drug effects. One additional superimposed dosage mitigated these effects in the direction of an antidepressant profile, with the inter-drug differences waning in the 6th hour. Our pharmaco-EEG findings suggest both inhibitory and excitatory drug effects underlying the antidepressant properties of SAMe well-documented in clinical trials. Psychometric tests concerning noopsychic and thymopsychic measures as well as critical flicker frequency generally demonstrated a lack of differences between SAMe and placebo, which again reflects a good tolerability of the drug in elderly subjects.<p>

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2002;76Summary: Background: S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe, or ademetionine) is a naturally occurring molecule used as both a nutraceutical and a pharmaceutical to treat depression. Objective: The central mode of action of SAMe was investigated in 20 healthy volunteers by mapping of electroencephalograms (EEGs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Design: In an acute and subacute, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, subjects received in random order infusions of 800 mg SAMe and placebo for 7 d, with a washout period of 3 wk between the 2 treatment periods. EEG recordings were made 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after and ERP recordings were made 0 and 1 h after the drug infusions on days 1 and 7. Results: Multivariate analyses of variance and Hotelling T2 tests showed significant acute and subacute encephalotropic effects of SAMe compared with placebo. Acute pharmaco-EEG changes were typical of classic antidepressants of the thymoleptic type; subacute alterations were typical of cognition enhancers. Regarding ERPs, standard N1 and P2 latencies were shortened, and target P300 latencies were lengthened. N1 amplitudes increased after subacute treatment, and temporooccipital P300 amplitudes increased after the acute dose. Similar changes were described for antidepressants. LORETA showed that the N2 source strength increased in both the left and the right temporal lobes, whereas the P300 source strength increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal regions and decreased in the ventral limbic regions. Conclusion: EEG-ERP mapping identified SAMe as an antidepressant. LORETA targeted brain regions crucial in the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants.<p>

Summary: The purpose of the studies summarized in this report was to determine the time course of auditory cortex involvement in speech and language processing in the context of auditory object formation. Forty-one subjects took part in the three studies summarized in this report. In all three studies, subjects performed a choice-reaction task that required their pressing an appropriate button in response to auditory stimuli (speech/non-speech, good/worse fused phonemes, first/second language words) presented through earphones. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during performance of the task from 21 scalp electrodes, in addition to peri-ocular electrodes for monitoring eye movements. Current densities within the gray matter of the brain were estimated using the LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography) method. In general, except for some periods, processing phonetic and linguistic information was associated with elevated activity in the left auditory cortex. Peaks in auditory cortex activation corresponded in time to scalp recorded peaks in the latencies of P1 and up to as late as P3. The adjacent posterior temporal areas showed a similar temporal pattern of activation, but tended to be less lateralized to the left, or even biased toward right hemisphere predominance, depending on the stimulus, particularly in the later time frames. The results indicate that the auditory cortex is engaged in auditory processing from its early stages and as long as a few hundreds of msec, even after cessation of the stimulus, defining sounds as distinct auditory objects and differentiating speech from non-speech material, relying on acoustic cues. Hemispheric dominance fluctuates to include activity in the 'non-dominant' hemisphere depending on stimulus type and stage of processing.<p>

Biological Psychiatry 2002;52:73-85.<p>
Summary: Background: The frontal lobe has been crucially involved in the neurobiology of major depression, but inconsistencies among studies exist, in part due to a failure of considering modulatory variables such as symptom severity, comorbidity with anxiety, and distinct subtypes, as codeterminants for patterns of brain activation in depression. Methods: Resting electroencephalogram was recorded in 38 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder and 18 normal comparison subjects, and analyzed with a tomographic source localization method that computes the cortical three-dimensional distribution of current density for standard electroencephalogram frequency bands. Symptom severity and anxiety were measured via self-report and melancholic features via clinical interview. Results: Depressed subjects showed more excitatory (beta3, 21.5-30.0 Hz) activity in the right superior and inferior frontal lobe (Brodmann's area 9/10/11) than comparison subjects. In melancholic subjects, this effect was particularly pronounced for severe depression, and right frontal activity correlated positively with anxiety. Depressed subjects showed posterior cingulate and precuneus hypoactivity. Conclusions: While confirming prior results implicating right frontal and posterior cingulate regions, this study highlights the importance of depression severity, anxiety, and melancholic features in patterns of brain activity accompanying depression. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.<p>

Summary: Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the fusiform gyri (FG) in structural encoding of faces, while event-related potential (ERP) and magnetoencephalography studies have shown that such encoding occurs approximately 170 ms poststimulus. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that processes involved in face recognition may be strongly modulated by socially relevant information conveyed by faces. To test the hypothesis that affective information indeed modulates early stages of face processing, ERPs were recorded to individually assessed liked, neutral, and disliked faces and checkerboard-reversal stimuli. At the N170 latency, the cortical three-dimensional distribution of current density was computed in stereotactic space using a tomographic source localization technique. Mean activity was extracted from the FG, defined by structure-probability maps, and a meta-cluster delineated by the coordinates of the voxel with the strongest face-sensitive response from five published functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. In the FG, ?160 ms poststimulus, liked faces elicited stronger activation than disliked and neutral faces and checkerboard-reversal stimuli. Further, confirming recent results, affect-modulated brain electrical activity started very early in the human brain (?112 ms). These findings suggest that affective features conveyed by faces modulate structural face encoding. Behavioral results from an independent study revealed that the stimuli were not biased toward particular facial expressions and confirmed that liked faces were rated as more attractive. Increased FG activation for liked faces may thus be interpreted as reflecting enhanced attention due to their saliency. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).<p>

<li>Phillips C, Rugg MD, Friston KJ: Anatomically informed basis functions for eeg source localization: Combining functional and anatomical constraints. NeuroImage 2002;16:678-695.<p>
Summary: Distributed linear solutions have frequently been used to solve the source localization problem in EEG. Here we introduce an approach based on the weighted minimum norm (WMN) method that imposes constraints using anatomical and physiological information derived from other imaging modalities. The anatomical constraints are used to reduce the solution space a priori by modeling the spatial source distribution with a set of basis functions. These spatial basis functions are chosen in a principled way using information theory. The reduced problem is then solved with a classical WMN method. Further (functional) constraints can be introduced in the weighting of the solution using fMRI brain responses to augment spatial priors. We used simulated data to explore the behavior of the approach over a range of the model's hyperparameters. To assess the construct validity of our method we compared it with two established approaches to the source localization problem, a simple weighted minimum norm and a maximum smoothness (Loreta-like) solution. This involved simulations, using single and multiple sources that were analyzed under different levels of confidence in the priors. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).<p>

<li>Phillips C, Rugg MD, Friston KJ: Systematic regularization of linear inverse solutions of the eeg source localization problem. NeuroImage 2002;17:287-301.<p>
Summary: Distributed linear solutions of the EEG source localization problem are used routinely. Here we describe an approach based on the weighted minimum norm method that imposes constraints using anatomical and physiological information derived from other imaging modalities to regularize the solution. In this approach the hyperparameters controlling the degree of regularization are estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). EEG data are always contaminated by noise, e.g., exogenous noise and background brain activity. The conditional expectation of the source distribution, given the data, is attained by carefully balancing the minimization of the residuals induced by noise and the improbability of the estimates as determined by their priors. This balance is specified by hyperparameters that control the relative importance of fitting and conforming to prior constraints. Here we introduce a systematic approach to this regularization problem, in the context of a linear observation model we have described previously. In this model, basis functions are extracted to reduce the solution space a priori in the spatial and temporal domains. The basis sets are motivated by knowledge of the evoked EEG response and information theory. In this paper we focus on an iterative &quot;expectation-maximization&quot; procedure to jointly estimate the conditional expectation of the source distribution and the ReML hyperparameters on which this solution rests. We used simulated data mixed with real EEG noise to explore the behavior of the approach with various source locations, priors, and noise levels. The results enabled us to conclude: (i) Solutions in the space of informed basis functions have a high face and construct validity, in relation to conventional analyses. (ii) The hyperparameters controlling the degree of regularization vary largely with source geometry and noise. The second conclusion speaks to the usefulness of using adaptative ReML hyperparameter estimates. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).<p>

<li>Pascual-Marqui RD, Esslen M, Kochi K, Lehmann D: Functional imaging with low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (loreta): A review. Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 2002;24:91-95.<p>
Summary: This paper reviews several recent publications that have successfully used the functional brain imaging method known as LORETA. Emphasis is placed on the electrophysiological and neuroanatomical basis of the method, on the localization properties of the method, and on the validation of the method in real experimental human data. Papers that criticize LORETA are briefly discussed. LORETA publications in the 1994-1997 period based localization inference on images of raw electric neuronal activity. In 1998, a series of papers appeared that based localization inference on the statistical parametric mapping methodology applied to high-time resolution LORETA images. Starting in 1999, quantitative neuroanatomy was added to the methodology, based on the digitized Talairach atlas provided by the Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute. The combination of these methodological developments has placed LORETA at a level that compares favorably to the more classical functional imaging methods, such as PET and fMRI. © 2002 Prous Science.

<li>Pascual-Marqui RD: Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sloreta): Technical details. Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 2002;24:5-12.<p>
Summary: Scalp electric potentials (electroencephalograms) and extracranial magnetic fields (magnetoencephalograms) are due to the primary (impressed) current density distribution that arises from neuronal postsynaptic processes. A solution to the inverse problem - the computation of images of electric neuronal activity based on extracranial measurements - would provide important information on the time-course and localization of brain function. In general, there is no unique solution to this problem. In particular, an instantaneous, distributed, discrete, linear solution capable of exact localization of point sources is of great interest, since the principles of linearity and superposition would guarantee its trustworthiness as a functional imaging method, given that brain activity occurs in the form of a finite number of distributed hot spots. Despite all previous efforts, linear solutions, at best, produced images with systematic nonzero localization errors. A solution reported here yields images of standardized current density with zero localization error: The purpose of this paper is to present the technical details of the method, allowing researchers to test, check, reproduce and validate the new method. © 2002 Prous Science.

Summary: We describe a method for the statistical parametric mapping of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and individual magnetic resonance images (MRI) to investigate the characteristics of the mismatch negativity (MMN) generators in schizophrenia. LORETA, using a realistic head model of the boundary element method derived from the individual anatomy, estimated the current density maps from the scalp topography of the 128-channel EEG. From the current density maps that covered the whole cortical gray matter (up to 20,000 points), volumetric current density images were reconstructed. Intensity normalization of the smoothed current density images was used to reduce the confounding effect of subject specific global activity. After transforming each image into a standard stereotaxic space, we carried out statistical parametric mapping of the normalized current density images. We applied this method to the source localization of MMN in schizophrenia. The MMN generators, produced by a deviant tone of 1,200 Hz (5% of 1,600 trials) under the standard tone of 1,000 Hz, 80 dB binaural stimuli with 300 msec of inter-stimulus interval, were measured in 14 right-handed schizophrenic subjects and 14 age-, gender-, and handedness-matched controls. We found that the schizophrenic group exhibited significant current density reductions of MMN in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus (P &lt; 0.0005). This study is the first voxel-by-voxel statistical mapping of current density using individual MRI and high-density EEG. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Oostenveld R, Oostendorp TF: Validating the boundary element method for forward and inverse eeg computations in the presence of a hole in the skull. Human Brain Mapping 2002;17:179-192.<p>
Summary: Holes in the skull may have a large influence on the EEG and ERP. Inverse source modeling techniques such as dipole fitting require an accurate volume conductor model. This model should incorporate holes if present, especially when either a neuronal generator or the electrodes are close to the hole, e.g., in case of a trephine hole in the upper part of the skull. The boundary element method (BEM) is at present the preferred method for inverse computations using a realistic head model, because of its efficiency and availability. Using a simulation approach, we have studied the accuracy of the BEM by comparing it to the analytical solution for a volume conductor without a hole, and to the finite difference method (FDM) for one with a hole. Furthermore, we have evaluated the influence of holes on the results of forward and inverse computations using the BEM. Without a hole and compared to the analytical model, a three-sphere BEM model was accurate up to 5-10%, while the corresponding FDM model had an error &lt;0.5%. In the presence of a hole, the difference between the BEM and the FDM was, on average, 4% (1.3-11.4%). The FDM turned out to be very accurate if no hole is present. We believe that the difference between the BEM and the FDM represents the inaccuracy of the BEM. This inaccuracy in the BEM is very small compared to the effect that holes can have on the scalp potential (up to 450%). In regard to the large influence of holes on forward and inverse computations, we conclude that holes in the skull can be treated reliably by means of the BEM and should be incorporated in forward and inverse modeling. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related magnetic fields (ERMFs) were combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study visual cortical activity in humans during spatial attention. While subjects attended selectively to stimulus arrays in one visual field, fMRI revealed stimulus-related activations in the contralateral primary visual cortex and in multiple extrastriate areas. ERP and ERMF recordings showed that attention did not affect the initial evoked response at 60-90 ms poststimulus that was localized to primary cortex, but a similarly localized late response at 140-250 ms was enhanced to attended stimuli. These findings provide evidence that the primary visual cortex participates in the selective processing of attended stimuli by means of delayed feedback from higher visual-cortical areas.<p>

Clinical Neurophysiology 2002;113:1566-1572.<p>
Summary: Objectives: The loudness dependency of the auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is used as an indicator of the central serotonergic system and predicts clinical response to serotonin agonists. So far, LDAEP has been typically investigated with dipole source analysis, because with this method the primary and secondary auditory cortex (with a high versus low serotonergic innervation) can be separated at least in parts. Methods: We have developed a new analysis procedure that uses an MRI probabilistic map of the primary auditory cortex in Talairach space and analyzed the current density in this region of interest with low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). LORETA is a tomographic localization method that calculates the current density distribution in Talairach space. Results: In a group of patients with major depression (n=15), this new method can predict the response to an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (citalopram) at least to the same degree than the traditional dipole source analysis method (P=0.019 vs. P=0.028). The correlation of the improvement in the Hamilton Scale is significant with the LORETA-LDAEP-values (0.56; P=0.031) but not with the dipole source analysis LDAEP-values (0.43; P=0.11). Conclusions: The new tomographic LDAEP analysis is a promising tool in the analysis of the central serotonergic system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging 2002;116:95-111.<p>
Summary: This study was performed in order to address the question whether the newly introduced technique of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) is able to detect hypofrontality in schizophrenic patients. We investigated resting EEGs of 19 unmedicated schizophrenics and 20 normal subjects. For comparison, we also investigated 19 subjects with schizotypal personality and 30 unmedicated depressive patients. A significant increase of delta activity was found in schizophrenic patients over the whole cortex, most strongly in the anterior cingulate gyrus and temporal lobe (fusiform gyrus). Both schizotypal subjects and depressive subjects showed significantly less delta, theta and beta activity in the anterior cingulum, a decrease of alpha1 activity in the right temporal lobe and a decrease of alpha2 activity in the left temporal lobe. The results suggest general cortical hypoactivation, most pronounced in the anterior cingulate and temporal lobe in schizophrenics, whereas there is evidence for a complex, frequency-dependent spatial pattern of hyperactivation in schizotypal subjects and depressive patients. The results are discussed within a neurophysiological and methodological framework. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Liu AK, Dale AM, Belliveau JW: Monte carlo simulation studies of eeg and meg localization accuracy. Human Brain Mapping 2002;16:47-62.<p>
Summary: Both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are currently used to localize brain activity. The accuracy of source localization depends on numerous factors, including the specific inverse approach and source model, fundamental differences in EEG and MEG data, and the accuracy of the volume conductor model of the head (i.e., the forward model). Using Monte Carlo simulations, this study removes the effect of forward model errors and theoretically compares the use of EEG alone, MEG alone, and combined EEG/MEG data sets for source localization. Here, we use a linear estimation inverse approach with a distributed source model and a realistic forward head model. We evaluated its accuracy using the crosstalk and point spread metrics. The crosstalk metric for a specified location on the cortex describes the amount of activity incorrectly localized onto that location from other locations. The point spread metric provides the complementary measure: for that same location, the point spread describes the mis-localization of activity from that specified location to other locations in the brain. We also propose and examine the utility of a &quot;noise sensitivity normalized&quot; inverse operator. Given our particular forward and inverse models, our results show that 1) surprisingly, EEG localization is more accurate than MEG localization for the same number of sensors averaged over many source locations and orientations; 2) as expected, combining EEG with MEG produces the best accuracy for the same total number of sensors; 3) the noise sensitivity normalized inverse operator improves the spatial resolution relative to the standard linear estimation operator; and 4) use of an a priori fMRI constraint universally reduces both crosstalk and point spread. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Khateb A, Pegna AJ, Michel CM, Landis T, Annoni JM: Dynamics of brain activation during an explicit word and image recognition task: An electrophysiological study. Brain Topography 2002;14:197-213.<p>
Summary: Recent brain imaging studies suggest that semantic processing of words and images may share a common neural network, although modality-specific activation can also be observed. Other studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) report that brain responses to words and images may already differ at ?150 ms following stimulus presentation. The question thus remains, which differences are due to perceptual categorization processes and which differences are due to the semantic ones? Using ERP recordings and spatio-temporal source localization analysis, we investigated the dynamics of brain activation during a recognition task. The stimuli consisted of a randomized set of verbal (words vs. non-words) and pictorial items (line drawings of objects vs. scrambled drawings). After each stimulus, subjects had to decide whether it corresponds to a recognizable word or objects. ERP map series were first analyzed in terms of segments of quasi-stable map topography using a cluster analysis. This showed that verbal and pictorial stimuli elicited different field patterns in two time segments between ?190-400 ms. Before and after this period, map patterns were similar between verbal and pictorial conditions indicating that the same brain structures were engaged during the early and late steps of processing. Source localization analysis of map segments corresponding to the P100 and the N150 components first showed activation of posterior bilateral regions and then of left temporo-posterior areas. During the period differentiating conditions, other patterns of activation, involving mainly left anterior and posterior regions for words and bilateral posterior regions for images, were observed. These findings suggest that, while sharing an initial common network, recognition of verbal and pictorial stimuli subsequently engage different brain regions during time periods generally allocated to the semantic processing of stimuli.<p>

Summary: Hemodynamic and electrophysiological studies indicate differential brain response to emotionally arousing, compared to neutral, pictures. The time course and source distribution of electrocortical potentials in response to emotional stimuli, using a high-density electrode (129-sensor) array were examined here. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. ERP voltages were examined in six time intervals, roughly corresponding to P1, N1, early P3, late P3 and a slow wave window. Differential activity was found for emotional, compared to neutral, pictures at both of the P3 intervals, as well as enhancement of later posterior positivity. Source space projection was performed using a minimum norm procedure that estimates the source currents generating the extracranially measured electrical gradient. Sources of slow wave modulation were located in occipital and posterior parietal cortex, with a right-hemispheric dominance.<p>

Summary: Objective: Many studies have demonstrated mismatch negativity (MMN) attenuation in schizophrenia. Recently, investigators have shown that GABAergic inhibitory neurons may regulate MMN generation. Considering that a substantial proportion of schizophrenic patients receive anxiolytics and hypnotics that have affinity to GABAA receptors to reduce their comorbid symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbances, we need to assess whether anxiolytics/hypnotics might affect their MMN generation. The aim of this study is to assess the possibility that high or low doses of anxiolytics/hypnotics received by schizophrenic subjects affect their mismatch negativity (MMN), using event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods: Twenty-three and 16 patients with schizophrenia participated in the ERP and MEG studies, respectively. Three types of MMN (MMN in response to a duration change of pure-tone stimuli, within-category vowel change (Japanese vowel /a/ with short versus long duration), and across-category vowel change (vowel /a/ versus /o/)) were recorded. Results: High or low doses of benzodiazepine had no significant effects on MMN amplitude/magnetic MMN power, topography/laterality, or latency under any conditions of the ERP or MEG study. Conclusions: These results suggest that chronic administration of anxiolytics/hypnotics does not significantly affect MMN in schizophrenia. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) of event-related potential components has been widely used to assess the ability of auditory automatic change discrimination of verbal and nonverbal stimuli in healthy individuals and patients with various illnesses. To clarify the role of gender differences in the MMN, we compared the amplitude, latency, and topography of tonal and phonetic MMN between healthy males and females, using a high-density (128 channel) electroencephalography montage. The MMN was evaluated in 18 right-handed male and ten age-matched female adults. The MMN in response to a duration change of pure tone and that in response to a phonetic change (Japanese vowel /a/ versus /o/ with 150-ms duration) were recorded. There were no significant differences in amplitude, latency, or laterality for either tonal or phonetic MMN between male and female subjects. This lack of evidence for effects of gender on MMN in response to duration change of tones or that in response to changes of phonemes with a short duration in normal adults may be of relevance to a growing number of researchers who are studying the MMN in healthy individuals and various clinical groups. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary: Schizophrenia is a major mental disorder, characterized by their set of symptoms, including hallucinatory-delusional symptoms, thought disorder, emotional flattening, and social withdrawal. Since 1980s, advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques have provided tremendous merits for investigations into schizophrenia as a brain disorder. In this article, we first overviewed neuroanatomical studies using structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and postmortem brains, followed by neurophysiological studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), in patients with schizophrenia. Evidences from these studies suggest that schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder, structurally and functionally affecting various cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects of human behavior. Second, we reviewed recent investigations into neurobiological basis for schizophrenic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and thought disorder) using these indices as well as hemodynamic assessments such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (f-MRI). Finally, we addressed the issue of the heterogeneity of schizophrenia from the neurobiological perspective, in relation to the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological measures. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

<li>John ER: The neurophysics of consciousness. Brain Research Reviews 2002;39:1-28.<p>
Summary: Consciousness combines information about attributes of the present multimodal sensory environment with relevant elements of the past. Information from each modality is continuously fractionated into distinct features, processed locally by different brain regions relatively specialized for extracting these disparate components and globally by interactions among these regions. Information is represented by levels of synchronization within neuronal populations and of coherence among multiple brain regions that deviate from random fluctuations. Significant deviations constitute local and global negative entropy, or information. Local field potentials reflect the degree of synchronization among the neurons of the local ensembles. Large-scale integration, or 'binding', is proposed to involve oscillations of local field potentials that play an important role in facilitating synchronization and coherence, assessed by neuronal coincidence detectors, and parsed into perceptual frames by cortico-thalamo-cortical loops. The most probable baseline levels of local synchrony, coherent interactions among brain regions, and frame durations have been quantitatively described in large studies of their age-appropriate normative distributions and are considered as an approximation to a conscious 'ground state'. The level of consciousness during anesthesia can be accurately predicted by the magnitude and direction of reversible multivariate deviations from this ground state. An invariant set of changes takes place during anesthesia, independent of the particular anesthetic agent. Evidence from a variety of neuroscience areas supporting these propositions, together with the invariant reversible electrophysiological changes observed with loss and return of consciousness, are used to provide a foundation for this theory of consciousness. This paper illustrates the increasingly recognized need to consider global as well as local processes in the search for better explanations of how the brain accomplishes the transformation from synchronous and distributed neuronal discharges to seamless global subjective awareness. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary: A boundary element method-based cortical potential imaging technique has been developed to directly link the scalp potentials with the cortical potentials with the aid of magnetic resonance images of the subjects. First, computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the new approach in a concentric three-sphere inhomogeneous head model. Second, the corresponding cortical potentials were estimated from the patients' preoperative scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) based on the boundary element models constructed from subjects' magnetic resonance images and compared to the postoperative direct cortical potential recordings in the same patients. Simulation results demonstrated that the cortical potentials can be estimated from the scalp potentials using different scalp electrode configurations and are robust against measurement noise. The cortical imaging analysis of the preoperative scalp SEPs recorded from patients using the present approach showed high consistency in spatial pattern with the postoperative direct cortical potential recordings. Quantitative comparison between the estimated and the directly recorded subdural grid potentials resulted in reasonably high correlation coefficients in cases studied. Amplitude difference between the estimated and the recorded potentials was also observed as indexed by the relative error, and the possible underlying reasons are discussed. The present numerical and experimental results validate the boundary element method-based cortical potential imaging approach and demonstrate the feasibility of the new approach in noninvasive high-resolution imaging of brain electric activities from scalp potential measurement and magnetic resonance images. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).<p>

Summary: We have developed a method for estimating the three-dimensional distribution of equivalent current sources inside the brain from scalp potentials. Laplacian weighted minimum norm algorithm has been used in the present study to estimate the inverse solutions. A three-concentric-sphere inhomogeneous head model was used to represent the head volume conductor. A closed-form solution of the electrical potential over the scalp and inside the brain due to a point current source was developed for the three-concentric-sphere inhomogeneous head model. Computer simulation studies were conducted to validate the proposed equivalent current source imaging. Assuming source configurations as either multiple dipoles or point current sources/sinks, in computer simulations we used our method to reconstruct these sources, and compared with the equivalent dipole source imaging. Human experimental studies were also conducted and the equivalent current source imaging was performed on the visual evoked potential data. These results highlight the advantages of the equivalent current source imaging and suggest that it may become an alternative approach to imaging spatially distributed current sources-sinks in the brain and other organ systems.<p>

Summary: Background: Brain electrical activity is a spatio-temporally distributed process. Cortical imaging techniques have been developed to reconstruct cortical activity from the scalp electroencephalographic or magnetoencephalographic measurements. Several cortical imaging approaches, such as the epicortical potentials and a dipole layer accounting for the cortical activity, have been used to represent brain electrical activity. Methods: A closed cortical dipole layer source model is used to equivalently represent brain electrical activity. The relationship between the primary brain electrical sources and the cortical equivalent dipole layer is derived from the theory of electromagnetics. Computer simulation studies were conducted using a 3-concentric-sphere head model to validate the proposed theory. The cortical equivalent dipole layer imaging approach was tested in both computer simulation and human visual evoked potential (VEP) experiments. Results: The strength of the cortical equivalent dipole layer is shown to be proportional to the electrical potential over the same surface generated by primary electrical sources, had the outer medium been replaced by air. The proposed theory was validated by computer simulation in a discrete system. Simulation and VEP experimental studies suggest the feasibility of applying the cortical equivalent dipole layer imaging approach for brain imaging. Conclusions: The cortical equivalent dipole layer model can equivalently represent the primary brain electrical sources throughout the entire brain surrounded by the dipole layer. The strength of the cortical equivalent dipole layer due to primary sources can be directly calculated according to the theory developed in the present study. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: The past decades have shown extraordinary progress in our ability to noninvasively image the functions of the human brain. Of particular interest is the recent trend in combining information from electrophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging, which we termed eMRI, to achieve high-resolution functional neuroimaging in both space and time domains. In this article, we review the recent progress in high-resolution functional neuroimaging, in particular the multimodal integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The state-of-the-art EEG inverse solutions based on different brain electric source models and various approaches to integrate the information from MRI are reviewed. The remaining challenges, future trends, and potential applications of the high-resolution functional neuroimaging research are discussed.<p>

Summary: We describe a methodology to apply current source density (CSD) and minimum norm (MN) estimation as pre-processing tools for time-series analysis of single trial EEG data. The performance of these methods is compared for the case of wavelet time-frequency analysis of simulated gamma-band activity. A reasonable comparison of CSD and MN on the single trial level requires regularization such that the corresponding transformed data sets have similar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). For region-of-interest approaches, it should be possible to optimize the SNR for single estimates rather than for the whole distributed solution. An effective implementation of the MN method is described. Simulated data sets were created by modulating the strengths of a radial and a tangential test dipole with wavelets in the frequency range of the gamma band, superimposed with simulated spatially uncorrelated noise. The MN and CSD transformed data sets as well as the average reference (AR) representation were subjected to wavelet frequency-domain analysis, and power spectra were mapped for relevant frequency bands. For both CSD and MN, the influence of noise can be sufficiently suppressed by regularization to yield meaningful information, but only MN represents both radial and tangential dipole sources appropriately as single peaks. Therefore, when relating wavelet power spectrum topographies to their neuronal generators, MN should be preferred. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the N300 and N400 effect to pictures that were semantically incongruous to a prior object name. Based upon theories of object identification, the semantic incongruity was manipulated to occur early or late in the object processing stream. Methods: High-density visual event-related potentials were measured in response to passively viewed black and white line drawings of common objects. Pictures were preceded with an object name at either the basic (categorical) or subordinate (specific) level. The object either matched or mismatched with the name. With subordinate level names, mismatches could be within- or between-category. Results: The N400 effect was found for both basic and subordinate level mismatches. The N400 was found for both the subordinate-within and subordinate-between. Comparison of the scalp distributions between these N400 effects suggested a common effect was found for all conditions. The N300 effect, however, was only found for between-category mismatches, and only when semantic expectations were high in the match baseline (subordinate matches). Conclusions: The findings are consistent with theories of object identification that suggest that objects are initially categorized prior to being identified at more specific levels. The N300 appears to reflect the categorisation while the N400 effect appears to be responsive to all semantic mismatches. Comparison of scalp topographies, functional differences, and different estimated cortical source locations suggest that the N300 and N400 are two distinct semantic effects that reflect aspects of object identification. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Attention deficits have been consistently described in schizophrenia. Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have focused on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) dysfunction as a possible mediator. However, recent basic research has suggested that the effect of attention is also observed as a relative amplification of activity in modality-associated cortical areas. In the present study, the question was addressed whether an amplification deficit is seen in the auditory cortex of schizophrenic patients during an attention-requiring choice reaction task. Twenty-one drug-free schizophrenic patients and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied (32-channel EEG). The underlying generators of the event-related N1 component were separated in neuroanatomic space using a minimum-norm (LORETA) and a multiple dipole (BESA) approach. Both methods revealed activation in the primary auditory cortex (peak latency ? 100 ms) and in the area of the ACC (peak latency ? 130 ms). In addition, the adapted multiple dipole model also showed a temporal-radial source activation in nonprimary auditory areas (peak latency ? 140 ms). In schizophrenic patients, significant activation deficits were found in the ACC as well as in the left nonprimary auditory areas that differentially correlated with negative and positive symptoms. The results suggest that (1) the source in the nonprimary auditory cortex is detected only with a multiple dipole approach and (2) that the N1 generators in the ACC and in the nonprimary auditory cortex are dysfunctional in schizophrenia. This would be in line with the notion that attention deficits in schizophrenia involve an extended cortical network. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).<p>

Summary: Summary. Based on recent findings from various areas of brain research the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) within the prefrontal cortex is increasingly considered as a brain region activated during tasks requiring conflict-monitoring and allocation of attention. In the present study with event-related potentials (ERPs) the question has been addressed, whether the NoGo-condition of the Continuous Performance Test is associated with enough conflict-monitoring and allocation of attention in order to activate the ACC in healthy controls. Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), a new three-dimensional source localization method, revealed significantly increased brain electrical activity during the NoGo-ERP as compared to the Go-ERP with its maximum located exactly within the ACC in four independent samples of healthy subjects. These results relate the conflict-monitoring requirements associated with inhibition of a prepared motor response (NoGo-condition) to a powerful brain electrical ACC-activity. This non-invasive, easy to perform and inexpensive electrophysiological measurement, therefore, provides a new method for the assessment of ACC-function in healthy subjects.<p>

Summary: The execution (Go) and the inhibition (NoGo) of a motor response are basic cognitive processes that can be assessed by means of a simple neuropsychological Go-NoGo task: the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Simultaneous electrophysiologic investigations revealed that the NoGo condition of the CPT is associated with a clearly more anterior brain electrical activity compared with the Go condition. Recently, it has been shown that this NoGo anteriorization effect during a response control paradigm can be measured quantitatively with the electrophysiologic centroid method. The objective of the current study, therefore, was to determine the long-term reliability of the topographic measures of cognitive response control (i.e., location of the Go and the NoGo centroid and the NoGo anteriorization). For this purpose, a 21-channel EEG was recorded twice from 13 healthy volunteers during their execution of a cued CPT (O-X version). The time interval between test and retest was 2.74 years (range, 2.41 to 2.97 years). Statistical analysis of the event-related Go and NoGo potentials revealed an excellent test-retest reliability, as expressed by Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients of more than 0.85 (P ? 0.0005) and intraclass correlation coefficients of more than 0.90 (P ? 0.0005) for all three topographic measures. These results indicate that these electrophysiologic parameters present with superior long-term reliability and that they may be applied as electrophysiologic trait markers of response control mechanisms in the human brain.<p>

Summary: In Go/Nogo tasks, ERP after Nogo stimuli generally reveals a negativity (Nogo-)N2 and a subsequent positivity (Nogo-)P3 over fronto-central scalp regions. These components are probably related to different subprocesses serving response inhibition, namely, modality-specific and general inhibition, respectively. In the present study we investigate whether aging or prolonged work (&quot;time-on-task&quot;) have an effect on N2 and P3. Twelve young and 12 elderly subjects performed simple Go/Nogo tasks to visual or auditory letter stimuli. Reaction times were longer after visual than after auditory stimuli, and longer in the elderly than in the young. The ERP results reveal a slight impairment of modality-specific inhibition (N2) in the elderly after visual, but not after auditory, stimuli. General inhibition (P3) was delayed in the elderly for both modalities, as was Go-P3 and RT. Hence, it appears that the response slowing of the elderly is the result of a slowing of the decision process whether to respond or to inhibit. Moreover, age appears to affect both aspects of inhibition in a different manner. No effects of time-on-task were found, which suggests that the inhibitory processes are fairly robust against mental fatigue.<p>

Summary: There is a growing interest in elucidating the role of specific patterns of neural dynamics-such as transient synchronization between distant cell assemblies-in brain functions. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) recordings consist in the spatial integration of the activity from large and multiple remotely located populations of neurons. Massive diffusive effects and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) preclude the proper estimation of indices related to cortical dynamics from nonaveraged MEG/EEG surface recordings. Source localization from MEG/EEG surface recordings with its excellent time resolution could contribute to a better understanding of the working brain. We propose a robust and original approach to the MEG/EEG distributed inverse problem to better estimate neural dynamics of cortical sources. For this, the surrogate data method is introduced in the MEG/EEG inverse problem framework. We apply this approach on nonaveraged data with poor SNR using the minimum norm estimator and find source localization results weakly sensitive to noise. Surrogates allow the reduction of the source space in order to reconstruct MEG/EEG data with reduced biases in both source localization and time-series dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations and results obtained from real MEG data indicate it is possible to estimate non invasively an important part of cortical source locations and dynamic and, therefore, to reveal brain functional networks.<p>

Summary: A number of brain regions are associated with the subjective experience of pain. This study adds to our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in pain by considering the relation between cortical oscillations in response to pain, with and without hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia, and the subjective experience of pain. Thirty-three subjects' neural responses (EEG) were measured during the 40-540 ms period following phasic electrical stimulations to the right hand, under control and hypnosis conditions. Resultant FFT amplitudes for frequencies ranging from 8 to 100 Hz were computed. These were grouped into 7 scalp topographies, and for each frequency, relations between these topographies and pain ratings, performance and stimulus intensity measures were assessed. Gamma activity (32-100 Hz) over prefrontal scalp sites predicted subject pain ratings in the control condition (r=0.50, P=0.004), and no other frequency/topography combination did. This relation was present in both high and low hypnotisable subjects and was independent of performance and stimulus intensity measures. This relation was unchanged by hypnosis in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during hypnosis, suggesting that hypnosis interferes with this pain/gamma relation. This study provides evidence for the role of gamma oscillations in the subjective experience of pain. Further, it is in keeping with the view that hypnosis involves the dissociation of prefrontal cortex from other neural functions. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: This article deals with a new approach in sleep characterization that combines EEG source localisation methods with standard frequency analysis of multielectrode EEGs. First, we describe the theoretical methodology and the benefits that we get from a three-dimensional image (LORETA) of the cerebral activity related to a frequency band. Then, this new application is used as signal-processing technique on sleep EEG recordings obtained from young male adults using four frequency bands (? 0.5-3.5 Hz, ? 4.0-7.5 Hz, and ? 8.0-12.5 Hz and ? 13.0-32.0 Hz) in different sleep stages. Finally, we show that the obtained results are highly consistent with other physiological assessments (standard EEG mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc.), but give us more realistic additional information on the generators of electromagnetic cerebral activity. © 2002 Acade?mie des sciences / E?ditions scientifiques et me?dicales Elsevier SAS.<p>

Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 2002;41:990-998.<p>
Summary: Objective: To measure specific neurophysiological attention deficits in children with hyperkinetic disorders (HD; the ICD-10 diagnosis for severe and pervasive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). Method: In a multicenter sample of 148 children with HD and control children aged 8 to 14 years, event-related potential maps were recorded during a cued continuous performance test (A-X/O-X). Maps to cues (requiring attention but no response) and distractors and performance were tested for differences between age- and sex-matched HD and control groups (n = 57 each), as well as between clinics (n = 5). Results: The N1, P3a, and P3b maps revealed reliable attention effects, with larger amplitudes after cues than after distractors, and only minor differences across clinics. Children with HD missed more targets, made more false alarms, and had larger N1 followed by smaller P3b amplitudes after cues than did controls. Cue-P3b amplitude correlated with detecting subsequent targets. Cue-P3b tomography indicated posterior sources that were attenuated in children with HD. Conclusions: Brain mapping indicates that children with HD attend to cues (preceding potential targets) with increased initial orienting (N1) followed by insufficient resource allocation (P3b). These multiple, condition-specific attention deficits in HD within 300 msec extend previous results on ADHD and underline the importance of high temporal resolution in mapping severe attention deficits.<p>

Summary: Utilizing computer-assisted quantitative analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with certain statistical procedures and under specific design conditions, it is possible to objectively evaluate the functional bioavailability of psychotropic substances in the target organ: the human brain. Specifically, one may determine whether a drug is active in the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo in humans, the dose effect (including nonmonotonic drug effects along the continuum range of concentrations) and the time effect (including time-dependent pharmacodynamic phenomena as tolerance and sensitization), as well as its activity in relation to the formulation and route of application. Methodological aspects are introduced, discussing the usefulness of evaluating different treatments, doses, time points, states, target variables, electrodes and even different groups. Several issues are raised in relation to acute vs. repetitive administration, particularly those dealing with statistical comparisons when making conclusions about acute, repetitive or superimposed effects, and in relation to human psychotropic interactions, such as mechanistic drug-drug interaction descriptions, drug metabolites and enantiomers, as well as the importance of acquiring drug plasma concentrations, elapse of time and topographic distributions to accurately identify its occurrence. PK-PD modeling is introduced as a tool to enlarge the scope of inferences that can be derived when using pharmaco-EEG. The examples presented in order to develop the arguments are mainly focused on anxiolytic compounds belonging to the different neurochemical groups, benzodiazepines and azaspirones. Questions that have yet to been resolved are also addressed. © 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.<p>

Summary: Objectives: In this paper, we employed advanced methods for the modeling of human cortical activity related to voluntary right one-digit movements from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Multimodal integration between EEG and fMRI data was performed by using realistic head models, a large number of scalp electrodes (128) and the estimation of current density strengths by linear inverse estimation. Results: Increasing of spatial details of the estimated cortical density distributions has been detected by using the proposed integration method with respect to the estimation using EEG data alone. Conclusion: The proposed method of multimodal EEG-fMRI data is useful to increase spatial resolution of movement-related potentials and can also be applied to other kinds of event-related patentials.<p>

Summary: After stroke, the interhemispheric reorganisation of the neural network implicated in language is hypothesized to be a function not only of the site of lesion but also of the residual impairment. With a multiple case approach, we tested this hypothesis in three chronic aphasic patients. Two patients, GE (capsulo-lenticular stroke) and JHN (fronto-temporal stroke) showed formal residual semantic difficulties, while the third patient (EG, large sylvian lesion) did not. Brain electric activity was analysed during a categorisation task of tachistoscopically presented words in the left and the right visual field. The temporal analysis of brain activity showed that both patients with semantic residual difficulties activated the right hemisphere (RH) during some steps of word processing. In the third patient, without semantic impairment, the RH was activated only during a short time period. Further more, RH activation was shown to be dependent on the visual field of word presentation. Phonological impairment was not predictive of RH activation. These results suggest that RH activation, particularly anterior regions, can occur during semantic processing of words as a function of semantic residual impairment.<p>

<li>Annoni JM: Language and hemispheric specialization. Langage et spe?cialisation he?misphe?rique 2002;12:275-317.<p>
Summary: Language is a highly lateralized cognitive function and has been the scope of multiple studies on the different role of the left hemisphere (LH) and the right hemisphere (RH). Based on structural language's models, clinical, behavioral and imaging data confirm the advantage of the LH in nearly all aspects of language processing. On the other hand, dynamic models postulate the presence of hidden or latent right hemispheric competencies, which can appear in certain situations. In this chapter we confirm the existence of dominant phonological, graphemic and lexico-semantic processes in the LH, and discuss the potential role of some latent functions, particularly in the RH. Data from clinical, behavioral sciences and neuroimaging support the following statements: i) cortical representation of language are naturally lateralized in the left hemisphere, but some steps such as prosodic comprehension and expression, some reading strategies and some aspects of lexico-semantic processes can take advantage of complementary functions in both hemispheres. ii) A tonic inter-hemispheric interaction, excitatory and inhibitory, has been demonstrated at least in the lexico-semantic processing. iii) Despite these interactions, neural networks involved in language are stable, and are barely modified by experimental changes in stimulus presentation. However, the pattern of activation of this network depends on the presentation. iv) Following focal lesion of the LH, compensatory homotopic areas of the RH can be used for language relearning. These compensatory areas do not seem to replicate the lost function but to use and adapt language functions anteriorly developed in this hemisphere. These compensatory activations vary according to the localization of the lesion.<p>

Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 2002;24:121-137.<p>
Summary: Middle latency and late components of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are closely related to perceptual and cognitive information processing, respectively. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the acute effects of lorazepam (2 mg), haloperidol (3 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg) and citalopram (20 mg) on ERP latencies, amplitudes, topographies and tomographies were investigated in 20 healthy subjects of 23-34 years of age. After automatic artifact minimization and rejection, standard N1 and P2 and target N2 and P300 components were determined. The tranquilizer lorazepam prolonged P300 latency, which indicates an impairment of stimulus evaluation time. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed decreases in N1 and P300 source strength in those brain regions with relevant generators of these components, which reflects impairments of attentional and cognitive processing resources. The neuroleptic haloperidol decreased N1 and P300 source strength predominantly in those brain regions not involved in the generation of these components, suggesting a shift of resources. The psychostimulant methylphenidate increased P300 source strength in brain regions with major P3b generators, indicating increases in energetic resources associated with stimulus encoding. The antidepressant citalopram increased N1 and P3b source strength in multiple brain regions specifically in the left prefrontal cortex, a brain region in which reduced blood flow and metabolism was found in depressed patients. © 2002 Prous Science.

<li>Anderer P, Gruber G, Klo?sch G, Klimesch W, Saletu B, Zeitlhofer J: Sleep and memory consolidation: The role of electrophysiological neuroimaging. Somnologie 2002;6:54-62.<p>
Summary: Memory consolidation involves a complex series of molecular, cellular and network-level processes that take place on time scales from millisecond to months. Evidence from a wide range of experimental observations supports the hypothesis that parts of these processes occur during sleep when the brain is not engaged in processing and encoding incoming information. Indeed, sleep seems to be favorable for brain plasticity. Experience-dependent cortical plasticity observed during sleep has been hypothesized to be part of the global process of memory consolidation. Thus, studying task-dependent, regionally specific reactivation of neuronal assemblies during posttraining sleep may make important contributions to elucidating the role of sleep in memory trace processing. A new methodology - low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) - offers the possibility of localizing electrical activity produced by cortical neuronal generators under normal (undisturbed) sleeping conditions. The high time resolution of brain electrical data can be exploited to produce neuroimages for specific EEG spectral frequency bands (e.g. delta, theta, or spindle bands). This makes it possible to investigate, dependent on the type of memory, when - in which sleep stages (S2 sleep, SWS, REM sleep) - and where - in which cortical brain regions (primary sensory cortex, higher association cortex) - experience-dependent reactivation occurs.<p>

Summary: The authors review the use of biomarkers in the development of novel psychotropic agents. They briefly review clinical drug development, emphasizing the importance of incorporating biomarkers. For the development of psychotropic agents, biomarkers are particularly useful for assessing central nervous system exposure and effects and for serving as surrogate measures for safety and efficacy. Collectively, biomarkers allow for more accurate estimation of doses for clinical trials as drug development progresses. For drugs that target the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease, several promising biomarkers are becoming available that may allow improved signal detection in clinical trials. Procedures for developing new drugs are evolving rapidly. Technical advances in the field are making it possible to shift from empirically-based methods to mechanistically-driven schemes. Biomarkers enhance the quality and safety of clinical drug development and reduce its cost and duration.<p>

<li>Yvert B, Crouzeix-Cheylus A, Pernier J: Fast realistic modeling in bioelectromagnetism using lead-field interpolation. Human Brain Mapping 2001;14:48-63.<p>
Summary: The practical use of realistic models in bioelectromagnetism is limited by the time-consuming amount of numerical calculations. We propose a method leading to much higher speed than currently available, and compatible with any kind of numerical methods (boundary elements (BEM), finite elements, finite differences). Illustrated with the BEM for EEG and MEG, it applies to ECG and MCG as well. The principle is two-fold. First, a Lead-Field matrix is calculated (once for all) for a grid of dipoles covering the brain volume. Second, any forward solution is interpolated from the pre-calculated Lead-Fields corresponding to grid dipoles near the source. Extrapolation is used for shallow sources falling outside the grid. Three interpolation techniques were tested: trilinear, second-order Be?zier (Bernstein polynomials), and 3D spline. The trilinear interpolation yielded the highest speed gain, with factors better than × 10,000 for a 9,000-triangle BEM model. More accurate results could be obtained with the Be?zier interpolation (speed gain ? 1,000), which, combined with a 8-mm step grid, lead to intrinsic localization and orientation errors of only 0.2 mm and 0.2 degrees. Further improvements in MEG could be obtained by interpolating only the contribution of secondary currents. Cropping grids by removing shallow points lead to a much better estimation of the dipole orientation in EEG than when solving the forward problem classically, providing an efficient alternative to locally refined models. This method would show special usefulness when combining realistic models with stochastic inverse procedures (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) requiring many forward calculations. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: The reported studies on EEG inverse by multiple signal classification (MUSIC) show the classical MUSIC algorithm suffers from two shortcomings: be sensitive to a color noise and fail in identifying synchronously active sources. Recent studies reveal that the MUSIC-based algorithm may be improved in depressing spatial coherent noise if the classical zero delay correlation matrix is replaced by a non-zero delay-correlation matrix, or by a high-order cumulant matrix, or by incorporating known noise covariance matrix in the zero-delay correlation matrix. And the MUSIC algorithm can be extended to identify synchronous actives through a recursive strategy. In this work, an iterative, multi-dimensional and delay-correlation MUSIC is proposed, where the color noise is depressed by the non-zero delay correlation and the synchronous active sources are identified by the iterative multi-dimensional MUSIC search. Simulation and VEP data tests show a good reconstruction is obtained.<p>

Summary: An algorithm was proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of solutions of the under determined electroencephalography (EEG) inverse problem. The self-coherence enhancement algorithm (SCEA) provides a self-coherence solution, which is a function of self-coherence estimate of the under determined EEG inverse solution. The high order self-coherence function was determined by the blurring level of the actual source distribution.<p>

Summary: It was the aim of the present study 1) to investigate how many cortical activity maxima of scalp-recorded P300 are detected by Low Resolution Electromagentic Tomography (LORETA) when analyses are performed with high time-resolution, 2) to see if the resulting LORETA-solution is in accordance with intracortical recordings as reported by others and 3) to compare the given pattern of cortical activation maxima in the P300-timeframe between schizophrenic patients and normal controls. Current density analysis was performed in 3-D Talairach space with high time resolution i.e. in 6 ms steps. This was done during an auditory choice reaction paradigm separately for normal subjects and schizophrenic patients with subsequent group comparisons. In normal subjects, a sequence of at least seven cortical activation maxima was found between 240-420ms poststimulus: the prefrontal cortex, anterior or medial cingulum, posterior cingulum, parietal cortex, temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, medial or anterior cingulum. Within the given limits of spatial resolution, this sequential maxima distribution largely met the expectations from reports on intracranial recordings and functional neuroimaging studies. However, localization accuracy was higher near the central midline than at lateral aspects of the brain. Schizophrenic patients less activated their cortex in a widespread area mainly in the left hemisphere including the prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulum and the temporal lobe. From these analyses and comparsions with intracranial recordings as reported by others, it is concluded that LORETA correctly localizes P300-related cortical activity maxima on the basis of 19 electrodes except for lateral cortical aspects which is most likely an edge-phenomenon. The data further suggest that the P300-deficit in schizophrenics involves an extended cortical network of the left hemisphere at several steps in time during the information processing stream.<p>

Summary: We investigated the generators of the mismatch negativity by means of spatio-temporal source imaging on the basis of 64-channel electroencephalography data in order to study the time course and localization of proposed frontal sources. Results indicate that there are additional generators located both within the anterior cingulate gyrus and in the right inferior temporal gyrus, clearly separated from the supratemporal generators in space and time course. The cingulate generator is activated later than the temporal ones, which supports the hypothesis of a frontally located mechanism of involuntary switching of attention triggered by the temporal change detection system. Evidence for an additional right inferior temporal generator supports the hypothesis of right hemispheric dominance in early sound discrimination. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Head movements during neuromagnetic measurements may cause a significant error in the estimated locations of active brain areas. In this study we present a fast method for measuring the head position while neuromagnetic data are acquired. We then compare two methods for removing the effect of the movements in neuromagnetic source estimation and magnetic field alignment: minimum-norm estimate alignment and forward calculation correction. Simulations and a test measurement show that the proposed head position measurement method works with millimeter precision and that incorporating the effect of the head movements into the magnetic field forward calculations is an efficient and a sufficiently accurate method for correcting for the head movements. © 2001 Academic Press.<p>

<li>Thayer ZC, Johnson BW, Corballis MC, Hamm JP: Perceptual and motor mechanisms for mental rotation of human hands. NeuroReport 2001;12:3433-3437.<p>
Summary: We measured brain potentials from human subjects performing a mental rotation task requiring right-left judgments of misoriented hands, and a control task requiring palm-back judgments of the same stimuli. High-density, 128-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 16 normal, right-handed subiects. There was a main effect of task at five different latencies: 148 ms (occipital), 180 ms (parietal), 388 ms (vertex), 556 ms (central-parietal), and 900 ms (vertex). Source estimations derived from topographic data indicate that frontal brain regions were strongly activated after 300 ms in the control task, but not until about 900 ms in the rotation task. We conclude that the neural computations underlying mental hand rotation may be recruited from relatively early stages of visuo-perceptual analysis; these early computations influence subsequent processing within a parietal-prefrontal system for the integration of perception with action. © 2001 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.<p>

<li>Szelenberger W, Niemcewicz S: Event-related current density in primary insomnia. Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis 2001;61:299-308.<p>
Summary: Using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), event-related current density was investigated in 14 patients with primary insomnia and 14 controls matched for age, gender and education level. All subjects were rated on the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Hyperarousal Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. They also completed the Selective Reminding Test and the Continuous Attention Test. Only minor elevations on depression scales were found in patients. The Continuous Attention Test did not reveal any between group differences. However, insomniacs required more trials before all the Selective Reminding Test items were learned. Insomniacs showed less event-related current density in orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, i.e. brain regions of relevance for cognition and affect. Earliest group differences appeared in the P1 time range and then were observed at the N1, N2 and P3 stages of stimulus processing, These stimulus processing differences correlated most consistently with severity of insomnia. Neuropsychological impairment correlated most strongly with less current density in Brodmann area 10.<p>

Summary: Interhemispheric interactions were studied with functional brain mapping of visual processing. Children performed a reaction time task with uni- and bilateral targets and nontargets. The visual evoked potential (VEP) was segmented into P1a, P1b, and N1 microstates using map rather than channel features. Map latencies, amplitudes and sources were tested for bilateral interactions. Bilateral targets yielded shorter VEP map latencies but later response onsets than unilateral ones. Source analyses of the unilateral VEPs indicated a transition from contra- (P1a) to ipsilateral (P1b) visual cortex activation (interhemispheric transfer). Bilateral VEPs were smaller than the summed unilateral VEPs in all microstates, indicating that interhemispheric interactions both precede and follow interhemispheric transfer. Brain mapping of uni- and bilateral VEPs in children thus revealed several distinct forms of interhemispheric interactions in the same, early time range.<p>

Summary: With the rapid developments in image processing, new clinical applications of manipulation and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of neuro-imaging are evolving. Combination with other non-invasive techniques aimed at localising electric sources in the brain is of particular interest. These techniques rely on the recording of brain electrical activity and/or the associated magnetic fields from multiple areas on the scalp. Data obtained from an electroencephalogram (EEG) or from magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be fused in 3-D arrangement with anatomical [magnetic resonance imaging/computerised tomography (MRI/CT)] and/or metabolic [positron emission tomography (PET)] data. Such techniques highlight information on the functional correlates of anatomical or space-occupying lesions and their role in the localisation of related symptomatic epilepsy. In the present study we report on methodological issues and preliminary clinical data on spectral EEG/MRI co-registration procedures, offering two examples of children presenting with hemispheric lesions, one frontal tumour and one temporal arterio-venous malformation. The EEG was acquired from 32/64 electrode location. The electrode position and that of four reference points were measured with a dual sensor Polhemus 3D Isotrak digitiser. Sources of EEG activity were determined in 3-D space with the inverse solution method low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), providing for each frequency component, the topographic distribution of active electrical sources. The positions of the reference points were also measured on MRI, and co-registration of EEG and MRI was achieved using a transformation algorithm. The reconstructed 3-D images of co-registered EEG/MRI clearly demonstrate the relationship between the space-occupying lesion and the epileptic activity. Preliminary results show that in all the patients it was possible to identify with a remarkable accuracy the 3-D topographic relationship between lesion and cortical areas showing localised abnormalities on the EEG. The present method could further enhance the understanding of the effect of resective treatment of structural lesions on brain functioning. The new combined images can be used in combination with image-guided surgery equipment to modify effective surgical resection.<p>

Summary: We have developed a method suitable for reconstructing spatio-temporal activities of neural sources by using magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data. The method extends the adaptive beamformer technique originally proposed by Borgiotti and Kaplan to incorporate the vector beamformer formulation in which a set of three weight vectors are used to detect the source activity in three orthogonal directions. The weight vectors of the vector-extended version of the Borgiotti-Kaplan beamformer are then projected onto the signal subspace of the measurement covariance matrix to obtain the final form of the proposed beamformer's weight vectors. Our numerical experiments show that both spatial resolution and output signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed beamformer are significantly higher than those of the minimum-variance-based vector beamformer used in previous investigations. We also applied the proposed beamformer to two sets of auditory-evoked MEG data, and the results clearly demonstrated the method's capability of reconstructing spatio-temporal activities of neural sources.<p>

Summary: The determination of the sources of electric activity inside the brain from electric and magnetic measurements on the surface of the head is known to be an ill-posed problem.

<li>Schairer KS, Gould HJ, Pousson MA: Source generators of mismatch negativity to multiple deviant stimulus types. Brain Topography 2001;14:117-130.<p>
Summary: The purpose of the present study was to investigate auditory stimulus feature processing and how neural generators might differ among the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to intensity, frequency, and duration deviant stimuli. Data collected from 72 electrodes in twelve adult female subjects were analyzed. For each subject, peak amplitude and latency values at Fz were compared among responses to the three deviant stimulus types presented in individual conditions with a probability of 0.10 and 0.30, and in the multiple deviant condition in which all three deviant types were presented (design based on Deacon et al. 1998). Further, equivalent current dipoles (ECD) for each deviant type, in each condition, and for each subject were calculated in three areas: right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and frontal. Peak amplitude and latency measured at Fz were consistent with previous findings by Deacon et al. (1998) and suggested parallel processing, perhaps by separate neural generators. However, ECD locations were not significantly different among the responses to the different deviant types. Further, the ECD magnitudes did not consistently reflect the differences in amplitude observed at the scalp among responses to the deviant types and conditions. The latter finding may indicate that the procedures were not sensitive enough to identify true differences among the generators. Alternatively, it was suggested that searching for separate neural generators at the cortical level may be too restrictive because the process may begin in subcortical areas, as indicated in animal models.<p>

<li>Prichep LS, John ER, Tom M: Localization of deep white matter lymphoma using vareta: A case study. Clinical EEG Electroencephalography 2001;32:62-66.<p>
Summary: Methods have recently been proposed for localization of multiple brain sources of particular EEG frequencies recorded from the scalp, to identify their most probable neuroanatomical generators. This paper reports the accurate localization of a deep white matter lymphoma, using Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (VARETA). The accuracy of this localization was confirmed by MRI studies. The patient was referred for a quantitative EEG evaluation, two weeks following an automobile accident, with no known loss of consciousness. There was marked excess and asymmetry of frontal slow wave activity, with highly significant hypocoherence. Significant gradient shifts within the left hemisphere were also seen. Visual inspection of the EEG tracings revealed theta paroxysms in left dorsolateral and mesial frontal regions. The MRI revealed a large space-occupying lesion deep within the white matter of the left frontal lobe, with evidence of subependymal spread and significant surrounding vasogenic edema. Localization of the sources of the maximal QEEG abnormalities using VARETA was consistent with the lesion location seen in the MRI images. This case demonstrates that VARETA can achieve highly sensitive and accurate localization of sources of QEEG abnormalities which lie in the deepest brain regions.<p>

Summary: Background: The P300 (P3) component of the event related potential has been established as a sensitive risk marker of vulnerability to alcoholism. Most alcoholism studies have focused on men; recent studies indicate that women are equally vulnerable to developing alcoholism. Methods: Visual P3 recorded from 31 electrode positions was evaluated in 44 alcoholic and 60 control women, 24-50 years of age. P3 amplitudes and latencies of the two groups were statistically compared using Analysis of Variance; source localization of surface amplitude values from each group were plotted using a low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Results: The results indicated that alcoholic women had significantly smaller P3 amplitudes in the frontal and central regions compared with controls. Source localization showed lowered activation in alcoholic women in right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the ventro-medial fronto-central regions. Conclusions: The results suggest that P3 is an equally sensitive endophenotypic marker of vulnerability to alcoholism in women. The findings are discussed in terms of functional and physiologic significance of the P3 amplitude in alcoholic women and its relationship to drinking behaviors.<p>

American Journal of Psychiatry 2001;158:405-415.<p>
Summary: Objective: The anterior cingulate cortex has been implicated in depression. Results are best interpreted by considering anatomic and cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. Evidence suggests depression is characterized by hypoactivity in the dorsal anterior cingulate, whereas hyperactivity in the rostral anterior cingulate is associated with good response to treatment. The authors tested the hypothesis that activity in the rostral anterior cingulate during the depressed state has prognostic value for the degree of eventual response to treatment. Whereas prior studies used hemodynamic imaging, this investigation used EEG. Method: The authors recorded 28-channel EEG data for 18 unmedicated patients with major depression and 18 matched comparison subjects. Clinical outcome was assessed after nortriptyline treatment. Of the 18 depressed patients, 16 were considered responders 4-6 months after initial assessment. A median split was used to classify response, and the pretreatment EEG data of patients showing better (N=9) and worse (N=9) responses were analyzed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, a new method to compute three-dimensional cortical current density for given EEG frequency bands according to a Talairach brain atlas. Results: The patients with better responses showed hyperactivity (higher theta activity) in the rostral anterior cingulate (Brodmann's area 24/32). Follow-up analyses demonstrated the specificity of this finding, which was not confounded by age or pretreatment depression severity. Conclusions: These results, based on electrophysiological imaging, not only support hemodynamic findings implicating activation of the anterior cingulate as a predictor of response in depression, but they also suggest that differential activity in the rostral anterior cingulate is associated with gradations of response.<p>

<li>O'Neill NS, Javidan M, Koles ZJ: Identification of the temporal components of seizure onset in the scalp eeg. Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences 2001;28:245-253.<p>
Summary: Background: The identification of the earliest indication of rhythmical oscillations and paroxysmal events associated with an epileptic seizure is paramount in identifying the location of the seizure onset in the scalp EEG. In this work, data-dependent filters are designed that can help reveal obscure activity at the onset of seizures in problematic EEGs. Methods: Data-dependent filters were designed using temporal patterns common to selected segments from pre-ictal and ictal portions of the scalp EEG. Temporal patterns that accounted for more variance in the ictal segment than in the pre-ictal segment of the scalp EEG were used to form the filters. Results: Application of the filters to the scalp EEG revealed temporal components in the seizure onset in the scalp recording that were not obvious in the unfiltered EEG. Examination of the filtered EEG enabled the onset of the seizure to be recognized earlier in the recording. The utility of the filters was confirmed qualitatively by comparing the scalp recording to the intracranial recording and quantitatively by calculating correlation coefficients between the scalp and intracranial recordings before and after filtering. Conclusion: The data-dependent approach to EEG filter design allows automatic detection of the basic frequencies present in the seizure onset. This approach is more effective than narrow band-pass filtering for eliminating artifactual and other interference that can obscure the onset of a seizure. Therefore, temporal-pattern filtering facilitates the identification of seizure onsets in challenging scalp EEGs.<p>

Summary: There is good evidence from neuroanatomic post-mortem and functional imaging studies that dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. So far, no electrophysiological localization study has been performed to investigate this deficit. We investigated 18 drug-free schizophrenic patients and 25 normal subjects with an auditory choice reaction task and measured event-related activity with 19 electrodes. Estimation of the current source density distribution in Talairach space was performed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). In normals, we could differentiate between an early event-related potential peak of the N1 (90-100 ms) and a later N1 peak (120-130 ms). Subsequent current-density LORETA analysis in Talairach space showed increased activity in the auditory cortex area during the first N1 peak and increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus during the second N1 peak. No activation difference was observed in the auditory cortex between normals and patients with schizophrenia. However, schizophrenics showed significantly less anterior cingulate gyrus activation and slowed reaction times. Our results confirm previous findings of an electrical source in the anterior cingulate and an anterior cingulate dysfunction in schizophrenics. Our data also suggest that anterior cingulate function in schizophrenics is disturbed at a relatively early time point in the information-processing stream (100-140 ms poststimulus). © 2001 Academic Press.<p>

Summary: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance images are new non-invasive techniques which have the potential for localization of the epileptogenic focus in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, who are candidates for surgery. Determination of patterns of asymmetry of the N-acetyl-aspartic acid (NAA) between homologous regions of the temporal lobes, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy contributes to preoperative lateralization in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. This technique may become a method for localization if its usefulness in the differentiation of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy from neocortical epilepsy is validated. Functional magnetic resonance images triggered by epileptiform discharges on the EEG, when combined with methods for localizing the source, permit the site of the epileptogenic focus to be found. This would particularly benefit patients with non-lesional extra-temporal epilepsy who are potential candidates for invasive recordings. The use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and junctional magnetic resonance images in the preoperative evaluation of patients with refractory focal epilepsy, especially if it is used together with the relevant clinical data and that from other structural and functional imaging techniques, will reduce invasive monitoring and increase the accessibility to surgical treatment for this condition.<p>

Summary: We review recent methodological advances in electromagnetic source imaging and present EEG data from our laboratory obtained by application of these methods. There are two principal steps in our analysis of multichannel electromagnetic recordings: (i) the determination of functionally relevant time periods in the ongoing electric activity and (ii) the localization of the sources in the brain that generate these activities recorded on the scalp. We propose a temporal segmentation of the time-varying activity, which is based on determination of changes in the topography of the electric fields, as an approach to the first step, and a distributed linear inverse solution based on realistic head models as an approach to the second step. Data from studies of visual motion perception, visuo-motor transfer, mental imagery, semantic decision, and cognitive interference illustrate that this analysis allows us to define the patterns of electric activity that are present at given time periods after stimulus presentation, as well as those time periods where significantly different patterns appear between different stimuli and tasks. The presented data show rapid and parallel activation of different areas within complex neuronal networks, including early activity of brain regions remote from the primary sensory areas. In addition, the data indicate information exchange between homologous areas of the two hemispheres in cases where unilateral stimulus presentation requires interhemispheric transfer. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

<li>Lian J, He B: A minimal product method and its application to cortical imaging. Brain Topography 2001;13:209-217.<p>
Summary: In order to reduce the spatial blurring effect due to the head volume conductor, cortical imaging technique (CIT) can be used to reconstruct the cortical potential distribution from the scalp potential measurement with enhanced spatial resolution. To overcome the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization (TIK) and truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) are commonly used by choosing the appropriate regularization parameter and truncation parameter, respectively. We have developed a minimal product method (MINP) to determine the regularization and truncation parameters. The present computer simulation and experimental results indicate that the MINP can be easily implemented in both TIK and TSVD with satisfactory performance, and suggest the potential applications of the MINP method in determining the corner of the L-curve.<p>

Summary: Multichannel EEG of an advanced meditator was recorded during four different, repeated meditations. Locations of intracerebral source gravity centers as well as Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) functional images of the EEG 'gamma' (35-44 Hz) frequency band activity differed significantly between meditations. Thus, during volitionally self-initiated, altered states of consciousness that were associated with different subjective meditation states, different brain neuronal populations were active. The brain areas predominantly involved during the self-induced meditation states aiming at visualization (right posterior) and verbalization (left central) agreed with known brain functional neuroanatomy. The brain areas involved in the self-induced, meditational dissolution and reconstitution of the experience of the self (right fronto-temporal) are discussed in the context of neural substrates implicated in normal self-representation and reality testing, as well as in depersonalization disorders and detachment from self after brain lesions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: Background: The site of atrioventricular pre-excitation can roughly be estimated with the help of schemes basing on a few number of electrocardiogram (ECG) leads. Computer algorithms have been developed which utilize the body surface mapping of the pre-excitation signal for the localization purpose. We tested several new algorithms. Method: A patient suffering from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was investigated prior the catheter ablation. The body surface mapping was performed with a 62-lead magnetocardiograph. The site of pre-excitation was calculated by using different methods: the dipole method with fixed and moving dipoles, the dipole scan on the endocardium, and different current density methods (L1 norm method, L2 norm method, low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) method, and maximum entropy method). Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) of the heart were used to visualize the results. The source positions were compared to the site of catheter ablation. Results: The accessory pathway was successfully ablated left laterally. This site was correctly identified by the conventional dipole method. By scanning the entire endocardial surface of the heart with the dipole method we found a circumscribed source area. This area too, was located at the lateral segment of the atrio-ventricular grove. The current density methods performed differently. Whereas the L1 norm identified the site of pre-excitation, the L2 norm, the LORETA method and the maximum entropy method resulted in extended source areas and therefore were not suited for the localization purpose. Conclusion: The dipole scan and the L1 norm current density method seem to be useful additions in the computational localization of pre-excitation syndromes. In our single case study they confirmed the localization results obtained with the dipole method, and they estimated the size of the suspected source region.<p>

<li>Lavric A, Pizzagalli D, Forstmeier S, Rippon G: Mapping dissociations in verb morphology. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2001;5:301-308.<p>
Summary: Substantial behavioural and neuropsychological evidence has been amassed to support the dual-route model of morphological processing, which distinguishes between a rule-based system for regular items (walk-walked, call-called) and an associative system for the irregular items (go-went). Some neural-network models attempt to explain the neuropsychological and brain-mapping dissociations in terms of single-system associative processing. We show that there are problems in the accounts of homogeneous networks in the light of recent brain-mapping evidence of systematic double-dissociation. We also examine the superior capabilities of more internally differentiated connectionist models, which, under certain conditions, display systematic double-dissociations. It appears that the more differentiation models show, the more easily they account for dissociation patterns, yet without implementing symbolic computations.

Summary: Objectives: Evidence of systematic double-dissociations of neural activity associated with the generation of regular and irregular past tense in healthy individuals may prove decisive in distinguishing between single- and dual-route models of morphological processing, because the former (connectionist models of morphological processing) have only been able to simulate double-dissociations of past-tense morphology as low-probability phenomena. Methods: Twenty-eight channel event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to past-tense production and subsequently analyzed using a 3-stage strategy. Results: A data-driven algorithm temporally segmented the ERPs into 16 distinct epochs of stable field configuration (microstates). A space-oriented brain electric field analysis determined that one of those epochs, 288-321 ms after the verb stem presentation, showed significant differences between the regular and irregular verb conditions. As a further test of these results, a novel source localization technique that computes 3-dimensional distribution of cortical current density in the Talairach brain atlas - low-resolution electromagnetic tomography - found in the above microstate more activity for regulars in the right prefrontal and right temporal areas and for irregulars in the left temporal areas and the anterior cingulate cortex, which can be taken as evidence of systematic double-dissociation. Conclusions: The present results achieved with a source localization technique provide evidence of a two-way compartmentalization of neural activity corresponding to regular and irregular past tense, thus corroborating the dual-mechanism character of verb morphology. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

<li>Lantz G, Spinelli L, Michel CM, De Peralta Menendez RG, Seeck M: Localization of distributed sources and comparison with functional mri. Localisation de sources distribue?es et comparaison avec l'IRM fonctionnelle 2001;3Summary: Functional mapping of the human brain has made tremendous progress in the past years thanks to new technical developments. Imaging methods are now available; they allow to study brain functions with high spatial and temporal resolution. Single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high resolution electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) are currently intensively applied techniques to functional studies, each one having specific properties concerning spatial and temporal resolution. The success of these methods in basic neuroscience research has led to the demand for applying them to clinical questions. Diseases of the central nervous system that lead to brain dysfunction can be ideally explored using these techniques. Of particular importance are those diseases in which a focal neuronal dysfunction is the primary cause and where surgical resection of this focus might be the cure. This is often the case for epilepsy, where a discrete primary focus might exist from which pathological rhythms evolve and propagate throughout the brain, leading to seizures that severely handicap the patient. Surgical resection of the primary focus is only possible if the focus can be exactly localized and adequately separated from functionally important areas. This is where these new functional imaging tools become important. The use of SPECT and PET for focus localization has been most extensively studied and their specificity and sensitivity are intensively discussed. In the last few years functional MRI has evolved as a new interesting tool in epileptic focus localization. The most important limitation of these techniques, however, is the temporal resolution. Since epileptic activity can propagate very fast, several hyper- or hypoactive regions are seen in the images and primary areas cannot be distinguished from regions of propagation. The only methods that have sufficient temporal resolution to follow neuronal activity in real time are the electrophysiological measures, i.e. the EEG and the MEG. Localization of the sources in the brain that produced a given surface electromagnetic field has become possible through algorithms that solve the so-called &quot;inverse problem&quot;. Several different algorithms exist and many groups begun to apply them to epileptic data with the aim to localize the focus of the pathological electrical discharges. This review article discusses the use of distributed EEG source localization procedures in the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable focal epilepsy. In contrast to equivalent dipole models, distributed localization methods do not localize one active point in the brain but rather assume extended active areas, which is generally the case in epileptic activity. The methods shown here are based on linear numerical methods and are therefore less prone to errors when working with scattered solution spaces such as the one defined by anatomical constraints. Solutions constraint to the gray matter determined in the individual MRI are shown here. We illustrate three methods to increase the spatial resolution of the source localization procedures: One is to increase the number of recording channels to more than 100, the second to use linear methods of high precision to detect focal sources (EPIFOCUS), and the third to combine EEG source localization with EEG-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging. The importance of EEG source localization for the interpretation of fMRI data will be particularly discussed in view of the important difference of the temporal resolution by the two methods. The localization methods can be applied to interictal as well as to ictal activity. In case of analysis of ictal EEG we propose to use full scalp frequency analysis to determine the time period of seizure onset and to localize the sources of the initial dominant frequency.<p>

Summary: Seven patients with complex partial epileptic seizures undergoing invasive video/EEG-monitoring were investigated with a combination of 10 subdural strip electrode contacts (subtemporal + lateral temporal), and 22 extracranial recording sites. In each patient spikes with different intracranial distributions were identified, and for those with similar distributions the extracranial activity was averaged. A new inverse solution method called EPIFOCUS (Grave et al. 2001, this issue) was used to reconstruct the sources of both single and averaged spikes in a standard 3D-MRI, and a statistical analysis was performed in order to demonstrate location differences between spikes with different intracranial distributions. The results revealed significantly more anterior and ventral source locations for subtemporal compared to lateral temporal spikes. Within the subtemporal group, medial spikes had more mesial and dorsal locations compared to lateral ones. In the lateral temporal group, more anterior and ventral locations were obtained for anterior compared to posterior spikes. The results demonstrate the applicability of EPIFOCUS in the localization of sources in the temporal lobe with sublobar accuracy. This possibility may bb2ecome important in the future, for instance in identifying cases where amygdalo-hippocampectomy or other limited temporal lobe resections may replace the standard en bloc resections.<p>

Summary: Cognitive theory posits association by juxtaposition or by fusion. We employed the measurement of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to a concept fusion task in order to explore memory encoding of these two types of associations between word pairs, followed by a memory test for original pair order. Encoding processes were isolated by subtracting fusion task ERPs corresponding to pairs later retrieved quickly from ERPs corresponding to pairs later retrieved slowly, separately for pairs fused successfully and unsuccessfully (i.e., juxtaposed). Analyses revealed that the encoding of these two types of associations yields different ERP voltage polarities, scalp topographies, and brain sources extending over the entire time course of processing.<p>

Summary: EEGs were recorded from 75 normal, young, female subjects during psychometrically matched verbal (WF) and spatial (DL) cognitive tasks to elicit the differences in the electrical source distribution inside the brain. Recordings were obtained using 43 EEG and 3 guard electrodes then visually edited and spatially filtered to remove extracerebral artifacts. Twenty 1-sec artifact-free epochs were obtained and analyzed from 42 and 60 subjects during WF and DL respectively. Of these subjects, 20 were placed in a training set and the remainder into a test set. The baseline for the comparison of the two tasks was established by factoring the average cross-spectral matrices of the training-set EEGs, computed in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands into spatial patterns common to the two tasks. Only those spatial patterns that contributed to the correct classification of subjects in the test set were included in the source analysis. The source-current density distributions were obtained using the LORETA-KEY© algorithm. The results show that the source-current density distribution is related to the putative functional activity in the brain in all three frequency bands. The electrical effects of the tasks are both most highly localized and lateralized in the theta band. The effects in the alpha and beta bands are much more generalized and are strongly lateralized only during one and the other of the tasks respectively. The conclusion is that WF is mainly a left central and bilateral frontal cerebral process while DL is mainly a right central and bilateral posterior cerebral process. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

Summary: Using visual half-field presentations of words to the right (RVF) and to the left visual field (LVF), this study investigated the time course of the hemispheric involvement in the processing of semantic category information. Multi-channel event related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 15 healthy subjects during a categorisation task of sequentially presented word pairs. Subjects had to judge mentally after the appearance of the second word whether the words of a pair were semantically related (SR) or not (SU). ERPs were computed, from 100 ms before the onset of the second word to 600 ms, for SR and SU conditions in the LVF and in the RVF separately. The temporal segmentation of ERP map series into sequences of quasi-stable map configurations revealed a total of seven segments in each visual field of which only the first five (S1-S5, appearing between 70 and 400 ms) showed different map configurations as a function of visual field but presented a similar temporal sequence in both visual fields. By contrast, of the last two segments (S6 and S7) which appeared between ?400 and ?600 ms, only S7 differentiated SR and SU conditions in terms of its duration. Source localisation analysis of the segments showed that following the initial activation of posterior brain regions as a function of the visual field of presentation, a common neural network was activated in the left hemisphere (LH) although the dynamics of activation varied as a function of visual field. Concerning the role of the right hemisphere (RH) in lexico-semantic processing, the results presented here appear to be compatible with a 'callosal relay model' and suggest that, in healthy subjects, information is transferred rapidly (?150 ms) from the RH to the language dominant-LH. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.<p>

<li>Jing H, Takigawa M, Okamura H, Doi W, Fukuzako H: Comparisons of event-related potentials after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Journal of Neurology 2001;248:184-192.<p>
Summary: Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the human cognitive process were investigated by examining auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in 15 healthy subjects. Two rTMS trains were delivered over the left frontal area, with 30 pulses in each train. ERPs were recorded at 14 electrode sites on the scalp using a typical oddball protocol before and after rTMS. Tone stimuli (20% target and 80% standard) were delivered through earphones. Latency and amplitude of N100, P200, N200 and P300 were measured and compared during the study. To observe information flow between two electrode sites, directed coherence (DCOH) was calculated on the ERPs. Our results show that the effect of rTMS differs in the various ERPs components (P &lt; 0.001). The latency of P300 significantly increased after stimulation, and the increase was more obvious in the frontal (18.6 ms) and central (15.8 ms) areas. The latency of P200 decreased in all areas. The amplitude of component N100 in the frontal and central areas decreased after rTMS. DCOH from the central area to the temporal area and DCOH from the parietal area to the temporal area were significantly higher than the DCOH between other areas (P &lt; 0.01), and these properties were not affected by rTMS (P &gt; 0.05). Information flow was driven from the frontal area to the parietal area after stimulation. Our results suggest that rTMS can suppress cognitive activities, showing an inhibitory effect on neurophysiological processes in the human brain. Since the temporal area is located at the terminus of the propagation pathways, it plays important roles in processing information in cognitive activities.<p>

Summary: Objective: Auditory event-related potentials (P300-ERPs) were analyzed before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Methods: Two rTMS trains (10 Hz, 3 s, 100% motor threshold and 5 min interval) were delivered over the left frontal area in healthy subjects. P300-ERPs were recorded at 14 electrode sites on the scalp using a typical oddball paradigm before and after rTMS. The latencies and amplitudes of N100, P200, N200 and P300 were measured and compared. The directed coherence (DCOH) was estimated to demonstrate information flow between different cortical areas. Results: rTMS significantly influenced P300-ERPs. The effects differed on the different components (P &lt; 0.001). The latency of P300 significantly increased after stimulation, which was more obvious in the frontal and central areas. The changes in P300 amplitude were not significant (P &gt; 0.05). The DCOH from the frontal, central, parietal and occipital areas to the temporal area was significantly higher than the DCOH from the temporal area to the former 4 areas (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: rTMS with the present parameters can affect P300-ERPs, leading to a delayed P300 component and changes in information connections around the stimulated site. Our data suggest that rTMS may postpone neuronal activities related to cognitive processing. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.<p>

<li>Jaus?ovec N, Jaus?ovec K: Differences in eeg current density related to intelligence. Cognitive Brain Research 2001;12:55-60.<p>
Summary: Differences in current density between high intelligent (IQ = 127), and low intelligent individuals (IQ = 87), while solving two oddball tasks (auditive and visual) were analyzed with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). In highly intelligent individuals a decrease in the volume of activated cortical gray matter between the P300 onset and the P300 peak amplitude was observed. The EEG of low intelligent individuals showed a reverse pattern of cortical activity. In the auditive oddball task the decrease in the activated cortical volume in high intelligent individuals was accompanied by an increase in current density, and a more left hemispheric source location at maximum current density. The results suggest that high intelligent individuals more efficiently distributed their cognitive resources needed to cope with the oddball tasks. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary: The engagement of different brain regions which implement subjectively experienced emotional states in normals is not completely clarified. Emotional states can conveniently be induced by hypnosis-based suggestions. We studied brain electric activity during hypnotically induced anxiety and relaxation in 11 right-handed normals (5 males, 6 females, mean age 26.5±7.6 years). After induction of light hypnosis, anxiety and then relaxation was suggested using a standardized text (reverse sequence in half of the subjects). Nineteen-channel, eyes-closed EEG (20 artifact-free s/subject) was analyzed (source localization using FFT approximation and low resolution electromagnetic tomography, LORETA). Global tests revealed the strongest difference (P&lt;0.005) between EEG source gravity center locations during the two emotional states in the excitatory beta-2 EEG frequency band (18.5-21 Hz). Post hoc tests showed that the sources were located more right during anxiety than during relaxation (P=0.01). LORETA specified that anxiety showed maximally stronger activity than relaxation in right Brodmann area 10, and relaxation showed maximally stronger activity than anxiety in left Brodmann area 22. Clearly, the two induced emotional states were associated with activity of different neural populations. Our results agree with reports on brain activity shifted to the right (especially fronto-temporal) during negative compared with positive emotions, and support the role of beta-2 EEG frequency in emotional states.

Summary: Individuals differ in hypnotizability. Information on hypnotizability-related EEG characteristics is controversial and incomplete, particularly on intracerebral source localization and EEG dimensionality. 19-channel, eyes-closed resting EEGs from right-handed, healthy, 8 high- and 4 low-hynotizable subjects (age: 26.7 ± 7.3 years) were analyzed. Hypnotizability was rated after the subjects' ability to attain a deep hypnotic stage (amnesia). FFT Dipole Approximation analysis in seven EEG frequency bands showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.04) of source gravity center locations for theta (6.5-8 Hz, more posterior and more left for highs), beta-1 and beta-2 frequencies (12.5-18 and 18.5-21 Hz; both more posterior and more right for highs). Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) specified the cortical anteriorization of beta-1 and beta-2 in low hypnotizables. Power spectral analysis of Global Field Power time series (curves) showed no overall power differences in any band. Full-band Global Dimensional Complexity was higher in high-hypnotizable subjects (p &lt; 0.02). Thus, before hypnosis, high and low hypnotizables were in different brain electric states, with more posterior brain activity gravity centers (excitatory right, routine or relaxation left) and higher dimensional complexity (higher arousal) in high than low hypnotizables.

<li>Idemen M, Alkumru A: New method for the source localization in sectionally homogeneous bounded domains involving finitely many inner interfaces of arbitrary shapes. International Journal of Engineering Science 2001;39:851-872.<p>
Summary: A new method to localize a static point source buried in a nonhomogeneous bounded domain composed of finitely many homogeneous parts separated by interfaces of arbitrary shapes was established. The source can be a simple point charge or current or a dipole of them. The method requires only the knowledge of the potential function ?(x,y,z) at five or six points on the outermost interface depending on whether the source is simple or dipole. The new and basic feature of the method consists of determining the potential function ?0(x,y,z) which would be observed if the whole space was filled with a homogeneous material. Then, in the case of a simple source, the position P0 as well as the strength s can be determined, in general, by solving a system of three linear algebraic equations. When the source consists of a dipole, its position P0 and moment p can be found by solving a system of six nonlinear algebraic equations. The determination of ?0, P0 and s (or p) is achieved iteratively by solving the above-mentioned algebraic equations along with a singular integral equation satisfied by ?0. Some illustrative examples show the applicability and accuracy of the method. The method can have effective applications in heat conduction, matter diffusion, electrostatics, steady-state current flow, electroencephalography, electrocardiography, etc.<p>

Summary: Objective: To investigate the value of cortical current density (CCD) reconstruction in localizing intracranial generators of interictal epileptiform activity in mesial and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: Non-linear minimum L1-norm CCD reconstruction (with current sources restricted to the individual cortical surface and a realistic boundary element method (BEM) head model) was used to localize and to study the propagation of interictal epileptiform EEG activity in 13 pre-surgical patients with TLE. Results: In all but one patient with mesial temporal lesions, an initial activation maximum corresponding to the ascending part of averaged sharp waves was found in the ipsilateral anterior basolateral temporal lobe, mostly extending up to the affected mesial structures whose resection rendered the patients seizure-free. In all 3 patients with lateral temporal lesions, the activation was initially confined to temporal neocortex immediately adjacent to the epileptogenic lesion. Towards the peak of sharp waves, two patients showed a propagation of interictal activity to anterior and posterior and partly contralateral temporal regions. A conventional EEG analysis based on amplitude maxima or phase reversal would have missed the initial onset zone. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that CCD reconstruction can be a valuable additional non-invasive component in the multimodal pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

<li>Hirota T, Yagyu T, Pascual-Marqui RD, Saito N, Kinoshita T: Spatial structure of brain electric fields during intermittent photic stimulation. Neuropsychobiology 2001;44:108-112.<p>
Summary: EEG changes in 27 young healthy male right-handed volunteers on intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) were estimated using global field power (GFP), EEG micro-state modeling and analysis (EMMA), and low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (LORETA). The GFP significantly increased at flashing frequency and high harmonics. Three model maps were extracted with the EMMA procedure, from which high alternation rates of each microstate were observed. Moreover, two of the three model maps contributed very highly, occurring most frequently. LORETA imaging of the three model maps obtained from the EMMA procedure showed that both visual dominant cortical areas were activated, especially in the left hemisphere. These results suggest that IPS does not cause peculiar spatial configurations of the brain electric field, but does cause acceleration and deviation of the microstate alternation. Also, a functional laterality between hemispheres might be enhanced by symmetric IPS. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.<p>

Summary: Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide information about the temporal course of cognitive processes in the brain. They have proved to be a valuable tool in order to explore semantic aspects of word processing. However, to date, research in this field has been mostly concerned with the study of post-lexical features by means of the N400-paradigm. We introduce here the rapid stream stimulation paradigm, in which stimuli reflecting different levels of linguistic information are presented to subjects at a high rate of stimulation. The present protocol shows in detail how this paradigm can be applied. The application of the rapid stream stimulation paradigm evokes the recognition potential (RP), an ERP component that peaks at around 260 ms after stimuli onset and seems to be reflecting lexical selection processes. Results of studies that revealed the sensibility of the RP to visual-semantic aspects and the location of its neural generators within basal extrastriate areas are reported. Although some research has been conducted with the rapid stream stimulation paradigm much remains still to be done. Some of the possibilities that this paradigm offers are further discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>He B, Wu D: Imaging and visualization of 3-d cardiac electric activity. IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine 2001;5:181-186.<p>
Summary: Noninvasive imaging of cardiac electric activity is of importance for better understanding the underlying mechanisms and for aiding clinical diagnosis and intervention of cardiac abnormalities. We propose to image the three-dimensional (3-D) cardiac bioelectric source distribution from body-surface electrocardiograms. Cardiac electrical sources were modeled by a current dipole distribution throughout the entire myocardium, and estimated by using the Laplacian weighted minimum norm (LWMN) algorithm from body-surface potentials. The estimated inverse solution of the current distribution was further improved by using a recursive weighting strategy for localized sources, such as origins of cardiac arrhythmias. Computer simulations were conducted to test the feasibility of the proposed approach by using a 3-D ventricle model embedded in a realistically shaped torso model. The boundary element method was used to solve the forward problem from assumed cardiac sources to the body-surface potentials. Two testing dipoles were placed in the left and right ventricles, simulating the early activation associated with ventricular arrhythmias. The LWMN inverse solution showed an equivalent source distribution over the entity of both ventricles, with spread areas of activity overlying the positions of the testing dipoles. The sharpened inverse image provides well-localized focal sources near the testing dipole positions. In summary, the present computer simulation suggests that the proposed 3-D cardiac current source imaging and localization approach appears to be a promising candidate for localizing J and imaging sites of origins of cardiac activation.<p>

Summary: Objective: To analyze whether the EEG changes observed during figure and word categorization are compatible with either the dual, the common amodal, or the alternative model (modality-specific codes for words and pictures, where meaning is represented for both in a higher-order amodal system) for semantic knowledge. Methods: EEG was recorded during word and figure categorization of animals or non-animals in a group of 28 children 8-10 years old. Computation of EEG sources in the frequency domain using variable resolution electrical tomography (VARETA) and their statistical evaluation by statistical parametric mapping were carried out. Results: At all frequencies, there were significant changes between EEG segments prior to the presentation of the stimuli and EEG segments recorded after the stimuli. Post-segments showed more power from 1.56 to 7.02 Hz, and less power than pre-segments from 8 to 12.48 Hz. EEG changes were only observed in the word task at: 3.9 (left occipital), 4.68, 5.46, and 6.24 Hz (temporo-occipital regions). These changes may be associated with visual encoding of words. Frequencies 7.8 and 17.94 Hz increased in prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal regions only during figure categorization. The prefrontal region may be related to object working memory. Thus, these frequencies might be related to figure codification. No significant differences between tasks were observed at 3.12 and 7.02 Hz in very wide brain areas (all lobes except occipital), suggesting that the amodal semantic system storage could be the model compatible with figure and word categorization. Conclusions: Thus, our results support the modified amodal semantic hypothesis, which advocates that the meanings of both kinds of stimuli are represented in a conceptual memory that receives input from the logogen and iconogen systems. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

<li>Gratton G, Goodman-Wood MR, Fabiani M: Comparison of neuronal and hemodynamic measures of the brain response to visual stimulation: An optical imaging study. Human Brain Mapping 2001;13:13-25.<p>
Summary: The noninvasive mapping of hemodynamic brain activity has led to significant advances in neuroimaging. This approach is based in part on the assumption that hemodynamic changes are proportional to (and therefore constitute a linear measure of) neuronal activity. We report a study investigating the quantitative relationship between neuronal and hemodynamic measures, This study exploited the fact that optical imaging methods can simultaneously provide noninvasive measures of neuronal and hemodynamic activity from the same region of the brain. We manipulated visual stimulation frequency and measured responses from the medial occipital area of 8 young adults. The results were consistent with a model postulating a linear relationship between the neuronal activity integrated over time and the amplitude of the hemodynamic response. The hemodynamic response colocalized with the neuronal response. These data support the use of quantitative neuroimaging methods to infer the intensity and localization of neuronal activity in occipital areas. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Gomez JF, Thatcher RW: Frequency domain equivalence between potentials and currents using loreta. International Journal of Neuroscience 2001;107:161-171.<p>
Summary: Analyzing the preferences of brain regions to oscillate at specific frequencies gives important functional information. Application of discrete inverse solutions for the EEG/ MEG inverse problem in the frequency domain usually involves the use of many current sources (sometimes 104 or more) restricted to gray matter points, as the solution space for the possible generators. This number can progressively increase with the level of detail of the MRI when it is used in co-registration with EEG/MEG. However, the computation of the Fourier transform to all these sources is computationally intensive. We illustrate with a simple example how this procedure can be simplified by applying the Fourier transform to the signals in the sensors using a popular inverse method (LORETA). We also suggest how the search space of current sources at specific frequencies of oscillation can be limited to some regions constrained by other technologies such as fMRI, PET and SPECT.<p>

<li>Gavit L, Baillet S, Mangin JF, Pescatore J, Garnero L: A multiresolution framework to meg/eeg source imaging. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2001;48:1080-1087.<p>
Summary: A new method based on a multiresolution approach for solving the ill-posed problem of brain electrical activity reconstruction from electroencephaloram (EEG)/magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals is proposed in a distributed source model. At each step of the algorithm, a regularized solution to the inverse problem is used to constrain the source space on the cortical surface to be scanned at higher spatial resolution. We present the iterative procedure together with an extension of the ST-maximum a posteriori method [1] that integrates spatial and temporal a priori information in an estimator of the brain electrical activity. Results from EEG in a phantom head experiment with a real human skull and from real MEG data on a healthy human subject are presented. The performances of the multiresolution method combined with a nonquadratic estimator are compared with commonly used dipolar methods, and to minimum-norm method with and without multiresolution. In all cases, the proposed approach proved to be more efficient both in terms of computational load and result quality, for the identification of sparse focal patterns of cortical current density, than the fixed scale imaging approach.<p>

Summary: Abstract: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy') is a psychostimulant drug producing heightened mood and facilitated social communication. In animal studies, MDMA effects are primarily mediated by serotonin (5-HT), but also by dopamine (DA) and possibly noradrenaline (NA). In humans, however, the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis of acute MDMA effects remains unknown. The distribution of active neuronal populations after administration of a single dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo was studied in 16 healthy, MDMA-nai?ve volunteers. Thirty-one-channel scalp EEGs during resting with open and closed eyes was analyzed in the different EEG frequency bands. Scalp maps of power showed significant, global differences between MDMA and placebo in both eye conditions and all frequency bands. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute 3D, functional images of electric neuronal activity from the scalp EEG data. MDMA produced a widespread decrease of slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional processes. Comparison of the MDMA-specific EEG pattern with that of various 5-HT, DA, and NA agonists indicates that serotonin, noradrenaline, and, to a lesser degree, dopamine, contribute to the effects of MDMA on EEG, and possibly also on mood and behavior. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.<p>

<li>Fallgatter AJ, Mu?ller TJ: Electrophysiological signs of reduced prefrontal response control in schizophrenic patients. Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging 2001;107:19-28.<p>
Summary: The prefrontal cortex is considered as a brain region important in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders. Based on converging results from different research areas, the prefrontal cortex is regarded as the anatomical and functional representation of response control under physiological conditions. In previous studies, a robust electrophysiological marker for the investigation of response control in healthy control subjects was validated. This parameter was termed NoGo anteriorisation and consists of a more anterior peak of the event-related potentials during the inhibition of a prepared motor response (NoGo condition within the Continuous Performance Test) than during its execution (Go condition). The present study investigated these brain electrical correlates of response control in 19 schizophrenic patients and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Compared to control subjects, the event-related potentials in schizophrenic patients were located more anterior in the Go condition and, as a trend, more posterior in the NoGo condition. The NoGo anteriorisation was strongly reduced in the schizophrenic group. On a qualitative level, the NoGo anteriorisation was present in all control subjects, but not in eight of the 19 patients. The results were interpreted as an indication of a disturbed prefrontal response control in schizophrenic patients. Further studies will clarify whether this method may be useful as a global test of hypofrontality in different groups of chronic schizophrenias, or as a quantifiable measure of an affected response control system, especially in catatonic subgroups. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

<li>Fallgatter AJ, Herrmann MJ: Electrophysiological assessment of impulsive behavior in healthy subjects. Neuropsychologia 2001;39:328-333.<p>
Summary: The different concepts of impulsivity cover a wide range of divergent behaviors. In clinical terms, aspects of impulsivity are both an important feature in several psychiatric conditions related to a low central serotonergic neurotransmission like aggressive behavior and suicidality, and a core symptom of frontal lobe syndromes of various etiologies. Assessment of the different forms of impulsivity so far relies on clinical observations and self-rating questionnaires. Measurements of a distinct brain function associated with impulsive behavior are not available yet, however, electrophysiological parameters of cognitive response control elicited with the execution (Go-condition) and the inhibition (NoGo-condition) of a prepared motor response within the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) might be suitable candidates. By means of a spatial analysis method the centers of gravity (centroids) of the brain electrical fields evoked with Go- and NoGo-responses can be localized and quantified. In the present study, the Go- and NoGo-centroids and the impulsivity score in Eysenck's I7-scale were determined in 22 healthy subjects (10 women, 12 men, mean age 42.0±10.1 years). Impulsivity was correlated with both, a more anterior location of the Go- (r=0.58, P&lt;0.01) and the NoGo-centroid (r=0.53, P=0.01). These results indicate, that in healthy subjects the amount of I7-impulsivity is associated with differences in the prefrontal brain activation pattern during cognitive response control. However, a replication study with a larger sample and an investigation of psychiatric patients with pathological levels of impulsivity are necessary to qualify these topographical ERP-parameters of cognitive response control as valid measures of the brain electrical basis of impulsive behavior.

Summary: Previously, the continuous performance test was demonstrated to elicit distinct electrophysiological correlates of cognitive response during execution (Go) and inhibition (NoGo) of an anticipated motor response. A robust method for topographical quantification of these brain electrical microstates has been established recently. Test reliability is crucial to allow application in the assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study evaluates the reliability of the Go and NoGo centroid locations as well as the NoGo anteriorisation (NGA) in 23 healthy individuals. Our results show supreme test-alternate retest reliabilities of Pearson's product moment correlations and intraclass correlation coefficients of r?0.63 (P?0.001) for these parameters which assert a quality well within the range reported for those of other electrophysiological standard paradigms. Go and NoGo centroid locations as well as the NGA are, therefore, reliable correlates of prefrontal motor control and may contribute to the understanding of disorders with allied impairments. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.<p>

<li>Fallgatter AJ: Electrophysiology of the prefrontal cortex in healthy controls and schizophrenic patients: A review. Journal of Neural Transmission 2001;108:679-694.<p>
Summary: Prefrontal brain regions, in particular the anterior cingular gyrus (ACG), are altered in chronic schizophrenic patients and also play a pivotal role in physiological mechanisms of response control. A cued Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a suitable paradigm for the investigation of response control, as it contains its fundamental mechanisms, i.e. the execution (Go) and the inhibition (NoGo) of an anticipated motor response. Previous electrophysiological investigations in healthy subjects during CPT execution revealed that the gravity center (centroid) of the event-related potential (ERP) elicited during the NoGo-condition is located more anterior as compared to the Go-condition in every single case. Moreover, by means of an electrophysiological source location method this NoGo-anteriorisation phenomenon (NGA) has been attributed to a strong brain electrical NoGo-hyperactivity located in prefrontal brain areas (ACG). Furthermore, the NGA has a superior test-retest reliability, a very high interindividual stability and is independent from age- and gender-effects. Systematic schizophrenic patients were characterized by a significantly diminished NGA indicating a dysfunction of prefrontal brain areas including the ACG. Based on these findings, the NGA has to be considered as a first electrophysiological measure for the quantitative assessment of ACG-function within a response control paradigm. Hopefully, this biological parameter will contribute to the elucidation of the etiopathogenetical background in different schizophrenic diseases.<p>

<li>Demiralp T, Ademoglu A: Decomposition of event-related brain potentials into multiple functional components using wavelet transform. Clinical EEG Electroencephalography 2001;32:122-138.<p>
Summary: Event related brain potential (ERP) waveforms consist of several components extending in time, frequency and topographical space. Therefore, an efficient processing of data which involves the time, frequency and space features of the signal, may facilitate understanding the plausible connections among the functions, the anatomical structures and neurophysiological mechanisms of the brain. Wavelet transform (WT) is a powerful signal processing tool for extracting the ERP components occurring at different time and frequency spots. A technical explanation of WT in ERP processing and its four distinct applications are presented here. The first two applications aim to identify and localize the functional oddball ERP components in terms of certain wavelet coefficients in delta, theta and alpha bands in a topographical recording. The third application performs a similar characterization that involves a three stimulus paradigm. The fourth application is a single sweep ERP processing to detect the P300 in single trials. The last case is an extension of ERP component identification by combining the WT with a source localization technique. The aim is to localize the time-frequency components in three dimensional brain structure instead of the scalp surface. The time-frequency analysis using WT helps isolate and describe sequential and/or overlapping functional processes during ERP generation, and provides a possibility for studying these cognitive processes and following their dynamics in single trials during an experimental session.<p>

Summary: The basics of magnetoencephalography (MEG), i.e. the measurement and the analysis of the tiny magnetic fields generated outside the scalp by the working human brain, are reviewed. Three main topics are discussed: (1) the relationship between the magnetic field and its generators, including on one hand the neurophysiological basis and the physical theory of magnetic field generation, and on the other hand the techniques for the estimation of the sources from the magnetic field measurements; (2) the instrumental techniques and the laboratory practice of neuromagnetic field measurement and (3) the main applications of MEG in basic neurophysiology as well as in clinical neurology.<p>

Summary: Among the different approaches to the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem, the current-density reconstruction methods (CDR) provide the most general solutions. Since the inverse problem does not have a unique solution, model assumptions have to be taken into account. Multi-channel measurements contain not only spatial, but also temporal information about the sources, so a naturally extension to existing methods leads to spatio-temporal model constraints. Spatio-temporal CDR's (stCDR) have been tested in simplified volume conductor models, assuming different spatial model constraints and a smooth temporal activation model. Comparison to existing spatial model constraints showed a significant improvement of spatial and temporal resolution of the reconstructed sources for the spatio-temporal models especial in noisy data.<p>

Summary: All-night electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded in a healthy subject with known alpha-delta sleep. Recordings were made from all 19 of the 10/20 system electrode sites, and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to estimate intracerebral current densities. Sleep stages were compared within classical frequency bands by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). With the onset of sleep, occipital alpha abated. With increasing depth of sleep, alpha power increased in a region comprising the left frontal lobe, the anterior and parietal cingulum, and the anterior and medial right front lobe. In slow wave sleep (SWS), frontal alpha power was much greater than in wakefulness. The maximum of frontal alpha power of SWS was localised symmetrically in the left and right anterior cingulum. The observed alpha activity was different from the occipital alpha characteristic of wakefulness; it was a distinct activity of separate origin. The anterior limbic lobes seemed to play an active part in SWS in this healthy volunteer with an alpha-delta sleep pattern. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>

<li>Carretie L, Marti?n-Loeches M, Hinojosa JA, Mercado F: Emotion and attention interaction studied through event-related potentials. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 2001;13:1109-1128.<p>
Summary: Several studies on hemodynamic brain activity indicate that emotional visual stimuli elicit greater activation than neutral stimuli in attention-related areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the visual association cortex (VAC). In order to explore the temporo-spatial characteristics of the interaction between attention and emotion, two processes characterized by involving short and rapid phases, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured in 29 subjects using a 60-electrode array and the LORETA source localization software. A cue/target paradigm was employed in order to investigate both expectancy-related and input processing-related attention. Four categories of stimuli were presented to subjects: positive arousing, negative arousing, relaxing, and neutral. Three attention-related components were finally analyzed: N280pre (from pretarget ERPs), P200post and P340post (both from posttarget ERPs). N280pre had a prefrontal focus (ACC and/or medial prefrontal cortex) and presented significantly lower amplitudes in response to cues announcing negative targets. This result suggests a greater capacity of nonaversive stimuli to generate expectancy-related attention. P200post and P340post were both elicited in the VAC, and showed their highest amplitudes in response to negative- and to positive-arousing stimuli, respectively. The origin of P200post appears to be located dorsally with respect to the clear ventral-stream origin of P340post. The conjunction of temporal and spatial characteristics of P200post and P340post leads to the deduction that input processing-related attention associated with emotional visual stimulation involves an initial, rapid, and brief 'early' attentional response oriented to rapid motor action, being more prominent towards negative stimulation. This is followed by a slower but longer 'late' attentional response oriented to deeper processing, elicited to a greater extent by appetitive stimulation.<p>

Clinical EEG Electroencephalography 2001;32:47-61.<p>
Summary: This article describes a new method for 3D QEEG tomography in the frequency domain. A variant of Statistical Parametric Mapping is presented for source log spectra. Sources are estimated by means of a Discrete Spline EEG inverse solution known as Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (VARETA). Anatomical constraints are incorporated by the use of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) probabilistic brain atlas. Efficient methods are developed for frequency domain VARETA in order to estimate the source spectra for the set of 103-105 voxels that comprise an EEG/MEG inverse solution. High resolution source Z spectra are then defined with respect to the age dependent mean and standard deviations of each voxel, which are summarized as regression equations calculated from the Cuban EEG normative database. The statistical issues involved are addressed by the use of extreme value statistics. Examples are shown that illustrate the potential clinical utility of the methods herein developed.<p>

Summary: Objective: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a Go/NoGo task were investigated to elucidate the electrophysiological basis for executive and inhibitory control of responses. Methods: We studied Go/NoGo ERPs in 13 healthy subjects during a modified continuous performance test using high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. We measured peak latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution of the components, and analyzed the neural sources using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. Results: There were no differences between the Go and NoGo conditions in the latency, amplitude, scalp topography, or the electrical source localization of the P1 and N1 components. The N2 component was seen only in the NoGo ERP, and its source was located in the right lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex. The NoGo-P3 component had larger amplitude and longer latency, and was more anteriorly localized than Go-P3; Go-P3 was located mainly in the medial part of the parietal cortex, whereas the NoGo-P3 activity was observed in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that the lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas play critical roles in the inhibitory control of behavior and that both hemispheres are involved in inhibitory cognitive function. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Summary: We investigated the usefulness of probabilistic Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for solving the magnetoencephalography (MEG) inverse problem, by using an algorithm composed of the combination of two MCMC samplers: Reversible Jump (RJ) and Parallel Tempering (PT). The MEG inverse problem was formulated in a probabilistic Bayesian approach, and we describe how the RJ and PT algorithms are fitted to our application. This approach offers better resolution of the MEG inverse problem even when the number of source dipoles is unknown (RJ), and significant reduction of the probability of erroneous convergence to local modes (PT). First estimates of the accuracy and resolution of our composite algorithm are given from results of simulation studies obtained with an unknown number of sources, and with white and neuromagnetic noise. In contrast to other approaches, MCMC methods do not just give an estimation of a &quot;single best&quot; solution, but they provide confidence interval for the source localization, probability distribution for the number of fitted dipoles, and estimation of other almost equally likely solutions.<p>

Summary: Disturbances of the motor and sensory system as well as an alteration of the preparation of movements have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of dystonias. However, it is unclear whether higher aspects of cortical - like cognitive - functions are also involved. Recently, the NoGo-anteriorization (NGA) elicited with a visual continuous performance test (CPT) during recording of a 21-channel electroencephalogram has been proposed as an electrophysiological standard-index for cognitive response control. The NGA consists of a more anterior location of the positive area of the brain electrical field associated with the inhibition (NoGo-condition) compared with that of the execution (Go-condition) of a prepared motor response in the CPT. This response control paradigm was applied in 16 patients with writer's cramp (WC) and 14 age matched healthy controls. Topographical analysis of the associated event-related potentials revealed a significant (P&lt;0.05) NGA effect for both patients and controls. Moreover, patients with WC showed a significantly higher global field power value (P&lt;0.05) in the Go-condition and a significantly higher difference-amplitude (P&lt;0.05) in the NoGo-condition. A source location analysis with the low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) method demonstrated a hypoactivity for the Go-condition in the parietal cortex of the right hemisphere and a hyperactivity in the NoGo-condition in the left parietal cortex in patients with WC compared with healthy controls. These results indicate an altered response control in patients with WC in widespread cortical brain areas and therefore support the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of WC is not restricted to a pure sensory-motor dysfunction.<p>

Summary: We used a real-skull phantom head to investigate the performances of representative methods for EEG source localization when considering various head models. We describe several experiments using a montage with current sources located at multiple positions and orientations inside a human skull filled with a conductive medium. The robustness of selected methods based on distributed source models is evaluated as various solutions to the forward problem (from the sphere to the finite element method) are considered. Experimental results indicate that inverse methods using appropriate cortex-based source models are almost always able to locate the active source with excellent precision, with little or no spurious activity in close or distant regions, even when two sources are simultaneously active. Superior regularization schemes for solving the inverse problem can dramatically help the estimation of sparse and focal active zones, despite significant approximation of the head geometry and the conductivity properties of the head tissues. Realistic head models are necessary, though, to fit the data with a reasonable level of residual variance.<p>

Summary: Analyses of scalp-recorded sleep spindles have demonstrated topographically distinct slow and fast spindle waves. In the present paper, the electrical activity in the brain corresponding to different types of sleep spindles was estimated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. In its new implementation, this method is based on realistic head geometry and solution space is restricted to the cortical gray matter and hippocampus. In multichannel all-night electroencephalographic recordings, 10-20 artifact-free 1.25-s epochs with frontally, parietally and approximately equally distributed spindles were marked visually in 10 normal healthy subjects aged 20-35 years. As a control condition, artifact-free non-spindle epochs 1-3 s before or after the corresponding spindle episodes were marked. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography demonstrated, independent of the scalp distribution, a distributed spindle source in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 10), oscillating with a frequency below 13 Hz, and in the precuneus (Brodmann area 7), oscillating with a frequency above 13 Hz. In extremely rare cases only the prefrontal or the parietal source was active. Brodmann areas 9 and 10 have principal connections to the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus; Brodmann area 7 is connected to the lateroposterior, laterodorsal and rostral intralaminar centrolateral thalamic nuclei. Thus, the localized cortical brain regions are directly connected with adjacent parts of the dorsal thalamus, where sleep spindles are generated. The results demonstrated simultaneously active cortical spindle sources which differed in frequency by approximately 2 Hz and were located in brain regions known to be critically involved in the processing of sensory input, which is in line with the assumed functional role of sleep spindles. © 2001 IBRO.<p>

International Journal of Psychophysiology 2000;38:107-142.<p>
Summary: Our previous research in patients with extensive surgical ablations of the prefrontal cortex contradict the hypothesis of some authors that the generators of several auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) (N100; P200; N200; P300; SW), recordable in humans with depth/scalp electrodes and MEG over the prefrontal dorsolateral cortical areas, are essentially located in medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate-limbic cortices. Using a standard CNV paradigm, 21 EEG electrodes and topographic mapping analysis, the post- warning (S1) auditory N100a b c, P200, P300 (binaural clicks) and CNV activity were recorded in three additional patients after extensive dorsolateral and/or medial prefrontal cortex ablations, verified through CT/MRI examinations. No true post-S1/CNV components were recordable over the ablated frontal areas, only sporadic volume-conducted ERPs probably generated in the temporo-parietal lobes or posterior cingulate gyrus. For one of these patients, after excision of a vast right frontal epileptogenic cortical region (including extensive dorsolateral areas, but sparing the fronto-medial cortex and anterior/middle cingulate gyrus), no post-S1/CNV components were recordable over the ablated regions. These latest observations again indicate that independent neuronal generators of several post-S1 auditory and CNV components are located in the dorsolateral supramodal premotor/prefrontal cortical areas which are directly, ipsilaterally connected to the uni/multimodal temporo-parieto-occipital sensory and associative regions through the long, two-way, fairly superficial, superior arcuate-longitudinal and deeper superior and inferior occipito-frontal bundles. Clear and almost constant differences in the latency of some post-S1 N100 subcomponents (especially the time-lapses between onset and the highest amplitude of the N100 a and c) over various posterior, central and anterior cortical areas sequentially involved, roughly measured in 10 normal subjects along the scalp and with MRI cerebral imaging, may probably be accounted for by the transcortical homohemispheric conduction time, which varies in our scalp recordings from 1 cm/0.74-1.28 ms, mean ~1 cm/1.02 ms (~9.8 ms).

Summary: Patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy and well-defined symptomatic MRI lesions were studied using phase-encoded frequency spectral analysis (PEFSA) combined with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Ten patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit with MRI-identified lesions and intractable partial epilepsy were studied using 31-electrode scalp EEG. The scalp electrodes were located in three-dimensional space using a magnetic digitizer and coregistered with the patient's MRI. PEFSA was used to obtain a phase-encoded scalp map for the ictal frequencies. The ictal generators were obtained from the scalp map using LORETA. In addition, the generators of interictal epileptogenic spikes were identified using time-domain LORETA. The LORETA generators were rostral to the MRI lesion in 87% (7/8) of patients with temporal lobe lesions, but all were located in the mesial temporal lobe in concordance with the patients' MRI lesions. In patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, the ictal generators at the time that the spectral power was maximal localized to the MRI lesions. Eight of 10 patients had interictal spikes, of which 4 were bilateral independent temporal lobe spikes. Only generators of the interictal spikes that were ipsilateral to seizure onset correlated with the ictal generators. LORETA combined with PEFSA of the ictal discharge can localize ictal EEG discharges accurately and improve correlation with brain anatomy by allowing coregistration of the ictal generator with the MRI. Analysis of interictal spikes was less useful than analysis of the ictal discharge.<p>

Summary: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)-receptors play a crucial role in the generation of electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations and evoked potentials (ERPs). The present association study was designed to test whether EEG and ERPs are modulated by genetic variations of the human GABA(A) ?2 (GABRB2) and ?2 (GABRG2) genes on chromosome 5q33. The genotypes of two nucleotide substitution polymorphisms of the GABRB2 and GABRG2 genes were assessed in 95 psychiatrically healthy subjects of German descent. Neurophysiological phenotyping was performed with four factorized EEG/ERP parameters: EEG activation, anterior and posterior EEG synchronization, and event-related activity (N100/P200-complex). No genotypic association was found for the GABRB2 nucleotide exchange polymorphism with any electrophysiological parameter. A significant association was found between the genotype of the intronic GABRG2 G?A nucleotide exchange and the event-related N100/P200 (ANOVA: F=3.81; df=2; P=0.026). A comparison of homozygous subjects carrying either the G/G or A/A genotype of the GABRG2 polymorphism consistently revealed an even stronger difference in the effect-size (ANOVA: F=11.13; df=1; P=0.002). Post hoc analysis of this association with current density analysis in three-dimensional neuroanatomic Talairach space-time showed a reduction in the event-related signal power after 120 ms in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Taking into account the risk of false-positive association findings attributable to multiple testing, our results encourage further replication studies to examine the phenotype-genotype relationship of GABRG2 gene variants and event-related prefrontal activity.<p>

<li>Wang Y, Oertel U: Estimating scalp meg from whole-head meg measurements. Brain Topography 2000;12:219-227.<p>
Summary: Studies based on whole-head MEG recordings are providing more and more impressive results. In such recordings, the MEG sensors are several centimeters away from the scalp and the positions of the MEG sensors with respect to the head differ from subject to subject, and from session to session for the same subject. In this paper, a method is presented and tested to estimate the scalp MEG distributions from whole-head MEG measurements. The goal is to remove the discrepancy of MEG measurements caused by the various sensor positions with respect to the head, as well as to reduce the smearing effect caused by the distance of the MEG sensors from the scalp. The MEG measurement was first projected to a hypothetical dipole layer within the head volume conductor model using the inverse solution. The scalp MEG estimation was then obtained from the resultant dipole layer by the forward solution. The results from simulation studies, phantom experiments, and the auditory evoked field analysis demonstrated that, with reasonable signal to noise ratios, this method is a feasible way to achieve our goals.<p>

<li>Vuilleumier P, Assal F, Blanke O, Jallon P: Distinct behavioral and eeg topographic correlates of loss of consciousness in absences. Epilepsia 2000;41:687-693.<p>
Summary: Purpose: To describe the behavioral and EEG topographic correlates of absences with 3-Hz generalized spike-waves and partitioned impairment of consciousness. Methods: Two adult women had so-called 'phantom' absences, characterized by brief and mild impairments of consciousness that were previously inconspicuous to both patient and physician. Neuropsychological examination was performed under video-EEG monitoring during absence status. EEG topographic mapping of spike-wave discharges was obtained in the two cases. Results: Only mild attentional and executive disturbances were observed during absence status despite prolonged discharges. Spike-wave bursts were associated with selective impairment in the initiation of response and self-generated action, whereas short-term storage of external information during discharges was fully preserved. This is consistent with a predominant involvement of frontomesial cortex demonstrated by topographic mapping of spike-wave discharges in the two cases. By contrast, in two other patients with typical absences and a complete lack of retention for information given during the discharges, topographic mapping found a more lateral frontal involvement by spike-wave activity. Conclusions: Different types of absence seizures may impair distinct components of conscious behavior. A predominant involvement of frontomesial thalamocortical circuitry may underlie an 'inconspicuous' disorder of consciousness as seen in phantom absences with selective loss of initiation and goal-oriented behavior, whereas involvement of more lateral frontal areas in typical absences may additionally disrupt working memory processes.<p>

Summary: Brain imaging studies in man and single cell recordings in monkey have suggested that medial supplementary motor areas (SMA) and lateral pre-motor areas (PMA) are functionally dissociated concerning their involvement in internally driven and externally cued movements. This dichotomy, however, seems to be relative rather than absolute. Here, we searched for further evidence of relative differences and aimed to determine by what aspect of brain activity (duration, strength, or both) these might be accounted for. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while healthy, right-handed subjects selected one of three possible right hand digit movements based either on 'internal' choice or 'external' cues. The results obtained from ERP mapping suggest that movement selection evokes the same electrical brain activity patterns in terms of surface potential configurations in the same order and at the same strength independent of the selection mode. These identical configurations, however, differed in their duration. Combined with the results of a distributed source localization procedure, our data are suggestive of longer lasting activity in SMA during the 'internal' and longer lasting activity in PMA during the 'external' condition. Our results confirm previous findings in showing that SMA and PMA are distinctively involved in the two tasks and that this functional dichotomy is relative rather than absolute but indicate that such a dissociation can result from differences in duration rather than pure strength of activation.

<li>Steger J, Imhof K, Steinhausen HC, Brandeis D: Brain mapping of bilateral interactions in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and control boys. Clinical Neurophysiology 2000;111:1141-1156.<p>
Summary: Objectives: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are thought to have deficits in attentional control, whereas the status of deficits at visual and pre-motor processing stages is unclear. Methods: The timing of such deficits was examined with event-related potential (ERP) microstates (stimulus- and response-related) and continuous force recordings in 15 ADHD and 16 control boys in a choice reaction time task. Unilateral and bilateral stimulus and response conditions were used to assess bilateral interactions at visual, central, and pre-motor stages. Results: ADHD boys showed poorer performance, particularly in the bilateral conditions. In the visual P1 microstates, they exhibited less suppression of visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes but similar speeding of VEP latencies in the bilateral compared to the summed unilateral condition. The central P3 and pre-/post-response microstates were attenuated and topographically altered in ADHD boys. The attenuation was most pronounced in the bilateral condition and was similar for stimulus- and response-related averages. The lateralized readiness potential was also reduced in ADHD boys; this was most pronounced for the left hand responses. Conclusions: Brain mapping during uni- and bilateral stimulus and response conditions thus indicates multilevel deficits in ADHD boys affecting visuo-attentional, central, and pre-motor processes.

<li>Spinelli L, Gonzalez Andino S, Lantz G, Seeck M, Michel CM: Electromagnetic inverse solutions in anatomically constrained spherical head models. Brain Topography 2000;13:115-125.<p>
Summary: Two classes of functional neuroimaging methods exist: hemodynamic techniques such as PET and fMRI, and electromagnetic techniques such as EEG/ERP and MEG. In order to fusion these images with anatomical information, co-registration with volumetric MRI is needed. While such co-registration techniques are well established for hemodynamic images, additional steps are needed for electromagnetic recordings, because the activity is only recorded on the scalp surface and inverse solutions based on specific head models have to be used to estimate the 3-dimensional current distribution. To date most of the experimental and clinical studies use multi-shell concentric sphere models of the head, solve the inverse problem on this simplistic model, and then co-register the solution with the MRI using homogeneous transform operations. Contrary to this standard method, we here propose to map the MRI to the spherical system by defining transformation operations that transform the MRI to a best-fitting sphere. Once done so, the solution points are defined in the cerebral tissue of this deformed MRI and the lead field for the distributed linear inverse solutions is calculated for this solution space. The method, that we call SMAC (Spherical Model with Anatomical Constrains) is tested with simulations, as well as with the following real data: 1) estimation of the sources of visual evoked potentials to unilateral stimulation from data averaged over subjects, and 2) localization of interictal discharges of two epileptic patients, one with a temporal, the other with an occipital focus, both confirmed by seizure freedom after resection of the epileptogenic region.<p>

<li>Schnitzler A, Gross J, Timmermann L: Synchronised oscillations of the human sensorimotor cortex. Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis 2000;60:271-287.<p>
Summary: Oscillations are a prominent feature of macroscopic human sensorimotor cortical activity as recorded non-invasively with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The advent of whole-scalp MEG systems allowing rapid non-invasive recording from the entire cortex and accurate localisation of neural sources, and the development of refined signal analysis methods are important factors that led to an increasing interest in studies of sensorimotor oscillations during the last 10 years. Investigations on healthy subjects revealed frequency-specific localisation and modality- specific reactivity of 10 Hz and 20 Hz sensorimotor oscillations. Task- specific coherence between motor cortical and electromyographic oscillations, reflecting cortico-motoneuronal coupling, point towards a functional role of precentral oscillations in the cortical control of voluntary movements. Furthermore, abnormal cortico-motoneuronal coupling may underlie clinical symptoms of motor disorders, such as tremor. Thus, investigation of oscillatory sensorimotor activity proceeds from phenomenology to function and provides an interesting approach to address questions in human motor physiology and pathophysiology.<p>

Summary: Objectives: Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that normative affective traits modulate the processing of facial and emotionally charged stimuli, direct electrophysiological evidence for this modulation is still lacking. Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) data associated with personal, traitlike approach- or withdrawal-related attitude (assessed post- recording and 14 months later) were investigated in 18 subjects during task- free (i.e. unrequested, spontaneous) emotional evaluation of faces. Temporal and spatial aspects of 27 channel ERP were analyzed with microstate analysis and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new method to compute 3 dimensional cortical current density implemented in the Talairach brain atlas. Results: Microstate analysis showed group differences 132-196 and 196-272 ms poststimulus, with right-shifted electric gravity centers for subjects with negative affective attitude. During these (over subjects reliably identifiable) personality-modulated, face-elicited microstates, LORETA revealed activation of bilateral occipito-temporal regions, reportedly associated with facial configuration extraction processes. Negative compared to positive affective attitude showed higher activity right temporal; positive compared to negative attitude showed higher activity left temporo- parieto-occipital. Conclusions: These temporal and spatial aspects suggest that the subject groups differed in brain activity at early, automatic, stimulus-related face processing steps when structural face encoding (configuration extraction) occurs. In sum, the brain functional microstates associated with affect-related personality features modulate brain mechanisms during face processing already at early information processing stages.

Summary: Event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from the human scalp can provide important information about how the human brain normally processes information and about how this processing may go awry in neurological or psychiatric disorders. Scientists using or studying ERPs must strive to overcome the many technical problems that can occur in the recording and analysis of these potentials. The methods and the results of these ERP studies must be published in a way that allows other scientists to understand exactly what was done so that they can, if necessary, replicate the experiments. The data must then be analyzed and presented in a way that allows different studies to be compared readily. This paper presents guidelines for recording ERPs and criteria for publishing the results.<p>

<li>Nunez PL, Silberstein RB: On the relationship of synaptic activity to macroscopic measurements: Does co-registration of eeg with fmri make sense? Brain Topography 2000;13:79-96.<p>
Summary: A two-scale theoretical description outlines relationships between brain current sources and the resulting extracranial electric field, recorded as EEG. Finding unknown sources of EEG, the so-called &quot;inverse problem&quot;, is discussed in general terms, with emphasis on the fundamental non-uniqueness of inverse solutions. Hemodynamic signatures, measured with fMRI, are expressed as vowel integrals to facilitate comparisons with EEG. Two generally distinct cell groups (1 and 2), generating EEG and fMRI signals respectively, are embedded within the much broader class of synaptic action fields. Cell groups 1 and 2 may or may not overlap in specific experiments. Implications of this incomplete overlap for co-registration studies are considered. Each experimental measure of brain function is generally sensitive to a different kind of source activity and to different spatial and temporal scales. Failure to appreciate such distinctions can exacerbate conflicting views of brain function that emphasize either global integration or functional localization.<p>

<li>Nolte G, Curio G: Current multipole expansion to estimate lateral extent of neuronal activity: A theoretical analysis. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 2000;47:1347-1355.<p>
Summary: High-resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows for a detailed description of focal neuronal current sources going far beyond the dipole approximation which merely indicates the center and magnitude of neuronal activity. Higher order multipole coefficients can be related to other bulk properties, like spatial extent or curvature. The possibility and limitations of measuring spatial extent by interpreting reconstructed multipole coefficients was tested under realistic noise conditions and for model misspecifications; for this analysis the primary cortical response ('N20') to electric median nerve stimulation was modeled by a one dimensional source distribution. The forward calculation was done analytically up to octapolar order for a spherical volume conductor. The multipole expansion is shown to estimate the lateral source extent with negligible bias; this estimate is to first-order stable against additional source features, like gyral curvature or spatial extent in a second direction (gyral depth, neuronal length). For a dipole moment of 20 nAm a lateral extent of 2 cm can be detected for a realistic noise level with large but experimentally still reasonable effort. Approximating a realistic head model by a sphere results in errors larger than the extent to be estimated; accordingly, studies on human cortical evoked responses will require multipole fitting in realistic head models.

Summary: Recent clinical and imaging studies suggest the involvement of anterior brain regions in the Stroop effect without providing consensus on the hemisphere being involved. Here, we investigated the dynamics of brain activation during a modified Stroop task using behavioural, event-related potential map series and source localization analysis. Behavioural analysis showed an increased RT in the interference (IC) as compared to the neutral (NC) and congruence conditions (CC). Map series analysis in these conditions displayed a similar sequence of 10 stable segments. From these, only segment S6, occurring at ~300 ms and displaying a dominant right anterior activation, was of increased duration in IC. Furthermore, in IC only, RT was shown to correlate with S6 duration. These results are discussed in terms of increased duration of an attentional process needed to solve the conflict.

<li>Grave de Peralta Menendez R, Gonzalez Andino SL: Discussing the capabilities of laplacian minimization. Brain Topography 2000;13:97-104.<p>
Summary: This paper discusses the properties and capabilities of linear inverse solutions to the neuroelectromagnetic inverse problem obtained under the assumption of smoothness (Laplacian Minimization). Simple simulated counter examples using smooth current distributions as well as single or multiple active dipoles are presented to refute some properties attributed to a particular implementation of the Laplacian Minimization coined LORETA. The problem of the selection of the test sources to be used in the evaluation is addressed and it is demonstrated that single dipoles are far from being the worst test case for a smooth solution as generally believed. The simulations confirm that the dipole localization error cannot constitute the tool to evaluate distributed inverse solutions designed to deal with multiple sources and that the necessary condition for the correct performance of an inverse is the adequate characterization of the source space, i.e., the characterization of the properties of the actual generators.<p>

Summary: Resting EEG during open and closed eyes and subsequent mood ratings were obtained from 15 Ecstasy users and 14 Ecstasy-naive controls. Absolute spectral power on the scalp, and the three-dimensional, intracerebral distribution of neuroelectric activity using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) were computed. LORETA revealed global increases of theta, alpha1 and beta2/3 power during eyes open in Ecstasy users, and spectral analyses revealed a right-posterior increase of alpha2 power (confirmed by LORETA) and increased beta band activity during open eyes. Ecstasy users had higher levels of state depressiveness, emotional excitability and a trend-level increase in state anxiety. The observed differences may be related to regular exposure to Ecstasy or other illicit drugs, or may be pre-existing.<p>

Summary: The P300-amplitude evoked with an acoustic oddball-paradigm is considered the most stable late event-related potential (ERP). This amplitude-index has become a standard parameter in electrophysiology. Recently, a robust ERP-parameter (NoGo-anteriorization, NGA) has been introduced, which reflects spatial brain electrical changes in relation to execution and inhibition of a motor response elicited with a Continuous Performance Test (CPT). The current study refers to the stability of this new topographical ERP-parameter compared to the stability of the classical P300-amplitude. For that purpose, 12 healthy subjects were investigated with both paradigms during recording of a 21-channel EEG. Analysis of the resulting ERPs revealed a very high stability for both, topographical and amplitude index: In every single subject, the brain electrical fields were characterized by a more anterior location in the NoGo- compared to the Go-condition (= NGA) and by higher amplitudes after target compared to distractor condition. T-tests, analyses of the effect size and of the power revealed equivalent differences between the two contrasting conditions for the topographical compared to the amplitude index. These results indicate that the stability of the topographical ERP-parameters elicited with the CPT is sufficient for an electrophysiological standard-index. The possibility to elicit a robust and specific spatial brain activation with the CPT is an ideal completion to the classical P300 amplitude effect and, therefore, hopefully will be a useful expansion of the standard paradigms in electrophysiological laboratories.<p>

Summary: Background: Since the measurement of human cerebral glucose metabolism (GluM) by positron emission tomography (PET) and that of human cerebral electrical activity by EEG reflect synaptic activity, both methods should be related in their cerebral spatial distribution. Healthy subjects do indeed demonstrate similar metabolic and neuroelectric spatial patterns. Objective: The aim of the study was to show that this similarity of GluM and EEG spatial patterns holds true in a population with a high variability of glucose metabolism. Methods: We investigated healthy control subjects and patients with varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction and varying GluM patterns by applying [18F]FDG PET and EEG. Results: We demonstrated that the localization of intracerebral generators of EEG correlates with spatial indices of GluM. Conclusion: These results indicates that EEG provides similar spatial information about brain function as GluM-PET. Since EEG is a non-invasive technique, which is more widely available and can be repeated more often than PET, this may have important implications both for neuropsychiatric research and for clinical diagnosis. However, further studies are required to determine whether equivalent EEG dipole generators can yield a diagnostic specificity and sensitivity similar to that of GluM-PET.

Summary: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effects of 20 mg buspirone - a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist - on regional electrical generators within the human brain were investigated utilizing three-dimensional EEG tomography. Nineteen-channel vigilance-controlled EEG recordings were carried out in 20 healthy subjects before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug intake. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Key Institute for Brain-Mind Research, software: http://www.keyinst.unizh.ch) was computed from spectrally analyzed EEG data, and differences between drug- and placebo-induced changes were displayed as statistical parametric maps. Data were registered to the Talairach-Tournoux human brain atlas available as a digitized MRI (McConnell Brain Imaging Centre: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca). At the pharmacodynamic peak (1st hour), buspirone increased theta and decreased fast alpha and beta sources. Areas of theta increase were mainly the left temporo-occipito-parietal and left prefrontal cortices, which is consistent with PET studies on buspirone-induced decreases in regional cerebral blood flow and fenfluramine-induced serotonin activation demonstrated by changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. In later hours (8th hour) with lower buspirone plasma levels, delta, theta, slow alpha and fast beta decreased, predominantly in the prefrontal and anterior limbic lobe. Whereas the results of the 1st hour speak for a slight CNS sedation (more in the sense of relaxation), those obtained in the 8th hour indicate activation. Thus, LORETA may provide useful and direct information on drug-induced changes in central nervous system function in man. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.<p>

<li>Aine C, Huang M, Stephen J, Christner R: Multistart algorithms for meg empirical data analysis reliably characterize locations and time courses of multiple sources. NeuroImage 2000;12:159-172.<p>
Summary: We applied our newly developed Multistart algorithm (M. Huang et al., 1998, Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 108, 32-44) to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) somatosensory responses and low SNR visual data to demonstrate the reliability of this analysis tool for determining source locations and time courses of empirical multisource neuromagnetic data. This algorithm performs a downhill simplex search hundreds to thousands of times with multiple, randomly selected initial starting parameters from within the head volume, in order to avoid problems of local minima. Two subjects participated in two studies: (1) somatosensory (left and right median nerves were stimulated using a square wave pulse of 0.2 ms duration) and (2) visual (small black and white bull's-eye patterns were presented to central and peripheral locations in four quadrants of the visual field). One subject participated in both of the studies mentioned above and in a third study (i.e., simultaneous somatosensory/visual stimulation). The best-fitting solutions were tightly clustered in high SNR somatosensory data and all dominant regions of activity could be identified in some instances by using a single model order (e.g., six dipoles) applied to a single interval of time (e.g., 15-250 ms) that captured the entire somatosensory response. In low SNR visual data, solutions were obtained from several different model orders and time intervals in order to capture the dominant activity across the entire visual response (e.g., 60-300 ms). Our results demonstrate that Multistart MEG analysis procedures can localize multiple regions of activity and characterize their time courses in a reliable fashion. Sources for visual data were determined by comparing results across several different models, each of which was based on hundreds to thousands of different fits to the data.<p>

<li>Winterer G, Herrmann WM, Coppola R: Electrophysiology in neuropsychiatrie research: A network perspective. CNS Spectrums 1999;4:17-29.<p>
Summary: A growing number of anatomic and physiologic studies have shown that parallel sensory and motor information processing occurs in multiple cortical areas. These findings challenge the traditional model of brain processing, which states that the brain is a collection of physically discrete processing modules that pass information to each other by neuronal impulses in a stepwise manner. New concepts based on neural network modeh suggest that the brain is a dynamically shifting collection of interpenetrating, distributed, and transient neural networks. Neither of these models is necessarily mutually exclusive, but each gives different perspectives on the brain that might be complementary. Each model has its own research methodology, with functional magnetic resonance imaging supporting notions of modular processing, and electrophysiology (eg, electroencephalography) emphasizing the network model. These two technologies might be combined fruitfully in the near future to provide us with a better understanding of the brain. However, this common enterprise can succeed only when the inherent limitations and advantages of both models and technologies are known. After a general introduction about electrophysiology as a research tool and its relation to the network model, several practical examples are given on the generation ofpathophysiologic models and disease classification, intermediate phenotyping for genetic investigations, and pharmacodynamic modeling. Finally, r proposals are made about how to integrate electrophysiology and neuroimaging methods.<p>

Summary: Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that selectively attending to a relevant stimulus feature was associated with selection negativity (SN) components. The present study aimed at investigating the ERP indices of attentional selection based on forms defined by motion (kinetic forms). ERPs were recorded from subjects who attended selectively to sequentially presented kinetic forms of bars in one visual field and detected occasional tilted bar targets. Two kinds of kinetic forms were used as the visual stimuli in separate experiments. The main findings were that spatial attention enhanced the amplitude of early ERP Components PI and N1 as well as the late component N2. Topographic maps of voltage and low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) of the dN2 wave (difference waveform between N2 under attended condition and N2 under unattended condition) suggested an origin in the right occipitotemporal cortex. According to its timing and morphology, the dN2 wave was considered to be an endogenous ERP (like the SN) and was interpreted as reflecting attentional facilitation of the processing of forms defined by motion primarily involving the right occipitotemporal areas.<p>

Summary: The locations of active brain areas can be estimated from the magnetic field the neural current sources produce. In this work we study a visualization method of magnetoencephalographic data that is based on minimum l1-norm estimates. The method can represent several local or distributed sources and does not need explicit a priori information. We evaluated the performance of the method using simulation studies. In a situation resembling typical magnetoencephalographic measurement, the mean estimated source strength exceeded baseline level up to 2 cm from the simulated point-like source. The method can also visualize several sources, activated simultaneously or in a sequence, which we demonstrated by analyzing magnetic responses associated with sensory stimulation and a picture naming task.<p>

Summary: Simple visuomanual reaction time tasks require interhemispheric communication when stimuli are presented in the hemifield opposite the responding hand. Although confirmed in many studies, it is still a matter of debate when, at what functional level and at what site this interhemispheric transfer takes place. To address these questions, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in 12 healthy subjects performing such a task and analyzed the data using techniques based on topographic ERP map characteristics. A method which has proved useful for associating ERP map configurations of different time periods with functional states of the brain was supplemented by a source localization procedure. The results suggest that transfer occurs late in time, on a functional motor level and at frontal sites, at least for left-to-right interhemispheric direction of transfer.<p>

<li>Schmidt DM, George JS, Wood CC: Bayesian inference applied to the electromagnetic inverse problem. Human Brain Mapping 1999;7:195-212.<p>
Summary: We present a new approach to the electromagnetic inverse problem that explicitly addresses the ambiguity associated with its ill-posed character. Rather than calculating a single 'best' solution according to some criterion, our approach produces a large number of likely solutions that both fit the data and any prior information that is used. Whereas the range of the different likely results is representative of the ambiguity in the inverse problem even with prior information present, features that are common across a large number of the different solutions can be identified and are associated with a high degree of probability. This approach is implemented and quantified within the formalism of Bayesian inference, which combines prior information with that of measurement in a common framework using a single measure. To demonstrate this approach, a general neural activation model is constructed that includes a variable number of extended regions of activation and can incorporate a great deal of prior information on neural current such as information on location, orientation, strength, and spatial smoothness. Taken together, this activation model and the Bayesian inferential approach yield estimates of the probability distributions for the number, location, and extent of active regions. Both simulated MEG data and data from a visual evoked response experiment are used to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach.<p>

<li>Saletu B, Anderer P: Eeg in psychiatry. EEG in der psychiatrie 1999;13:161-177.<p>
Summary: Since the development of the EEG by Hans Berger in 1929 there has been increasing evidence that mental disorders are caused by aberrant electrophysiological brain function. Findings were initially based on visual, later on computer-assisted quantitative analyses. This article gives an overview of sources and registration techniques of normal and abnormal brain waves and provides an insight into quantitative EEG analysis and EEG mapping. It includes a description of EEG findings in the most important mental disorders such as schizophrenia with predominantly negative and positive symptomatology, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, multiinfarct dementia, dementia of the Alzheimer type and alcohol dependence. Moreover, EEG changes after the major representative drugs of the main psychopharmacological classes such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, anxiolytic sedatives, psychostimulants and nootropics are described. It is interesting that the EEG changes in mental disorders are opposite to those induced by the psychotropic drugs indicated for the treatment of the former. By means of pharmaco EEG one may determine if, how, when and at which dosage a drug acts on the target organ - the human brain. Based on multiple-channel recordings of the EEG and of event-related potentials with subsequent neuroimaging in 2 dimensions (mapping) and 3 dimensions (EEG-CT: LORETA = low resolution electromagnetic tomography) it seems possible to show differences in brain function between an individual patient and normal controls (e.g. Z-values = number of standard deviations from the norm), which is the basis for neurophysiological classification of psychiatric disorders and thus makes it possible to choose the optimum drug treatment. Thus, the EEG may represent a valuable objective and quantitative instrument in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.<p>

Summary: Evoked potentials to brief 1000-Hz tones presented to either the left or the right ear were recorded from 30 electrodes arrayed over the head. These recordings were submitted to two different forms of source analysis: brain electric source analysis (BESA) and variable-resolution electromagnetic tomography (VARETA). Both analyses showed that the dominant intracerebral sources for the late auditory-evoked potentials (50-300 ms) were in the supratemporal plane and lateral temporal lobe contralateral to the ear of stimulation. The analyses also suggested the possibility of additional sources in the frontal lobes.<p>

Summary: Functional imaging of brain electrical activity was performed in nine acute, neuroleptic-naive, first-episode, productive patients with schizophrenia and 36 control subjects. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA, three-dimensional images of cortical current density) was computed from 19-channel of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity obtained under resting conditions, separately for the different EEG frequencies. Three patterns of activity were evident in the patients: (1) an anterior, near-bilateral excess of delta frequency activity; (2) an anterior-inferior deficit of theta frequency activity coupled with an anterior-inferior left-sided deficit of alpha-1 and alpha-2 frequency activity; and (3) a posterior-superior right-sided excess of beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3 frequency activity. Patients showed deviations from normal brain activity as evidenced by LORETA along an anterior-left-to-posterior-right spatial axis. The high temporal resolution of EEG makes it possible to specify the deviations not only as excess or deficit, but also as inhibitory, normal and excitatory. The patients showed a dis-coordinated brain functional state consisting of inhibited prefrontal/frontal areas and simultaneously overexcited right parietal areas, while left anterior, left temporal and left central areas lacked normal routine activity. Since all information processing is brain-state dependent, this dis-coordinated state must result in inadequate treatment of (externally or internally generated) information.

Summary: A study was carried out to address the question of whether the functional localization of dynamic sources of interictal activity in patients with well-defined frontal lesions would yield clear evidence regarding both the topology of the primary sources in relation to the epileptogenic lesion and the pattern of spread of the epileptiform activity throughout the brain. High-resolution EEG recordings combined with MRI, as well as advanced source-reconstruction algorithms were used. For this study, data was obtained only from one patient. Extensive analysis of the data enabled to assess the power of different algorithms in determining the functional localization of dynamic sources of interictal activity.<p>

Summary: Equivalent current dipoles are a powerful tool for modeling focal sources. The dipole is often sufficient to adequately represent sources of measured scalp potentials, even when the area of activation exceeds 1 cm2 of cortex. Traditional least-squares fitting techniques involve minimization of an error function with respect to the location and orientation of the dipoles. The existence of multiple local minima in this error function can result in gross errors in the computed source locations. The problem is further compounded by the requirement that the model order, i.e. the number of dipoles, be determined before error minimization can be performed. An incorrect model order can produce additional errors in the estimated source parameters. Both of these problems can be avoided using alternative search strategies based on the MUSIC (multiple signal classification) algorithm. Here the authors review the MUSIC approach and demonstrate its application to the localization of multiple current dipoles from EEG data. The authors also show that the number of detectable sources can be determined in a recursive manner from the data. Also, in contrast to least-squares, the method can find dipolar sources in the presence of additional non-dipolar sources. Finally, extensions of the MUSIC approach to allow the modeling of distributed sources are discussed.<p>

Summary: In the attempts to localize electric sources in the brain on the basis of multichannel EEG and/or MEG measurements, distributed source estimation procedures have become of increasing interest. Several commercial software packages offer such localization programs and results using these methods are seen more and more frequently in the literature. It is crucial that the users understand the similarities and differences of these methods and that they become aware of the advantages and limitations that are inherent to each approach. This review provides this information from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view. The theoretical part gives the algorithmic basis of the electromagnetic inverse problem and shows how the different a priori assumptions are formally integrated in these equations. The authors restrict this formalism to the linear inverse solutions i.e., those solutions in which the inversion procedure can be represented as a matrix applied to the data. It will be shown that their properties can be best characterized by their resolution kernels and that methods with optimal resolution matrices can be designed. The authors also discuss the important problem of regularization strategies that are used to minimize the influence of noise. Finally, a new kind of inverse solution, termed ELECTRA (for ELECTRical Analysis), is presented that is based on constraining the source model on the basis of the currents that can actually be measured by the scalp recorded EEG. The practical part of the review illustrates the localization procedures with different clinical data sets. Three aspects become important when working with real data: 1)Clinical data is usually far from ideal (limited number of electrodes, noise, etc.). The behavior of inverse procedures in such unfortunate situations has to be evaluated. 2) The selection of the time points or time periods of interest is crucial, especially in the analysis of spontaneous EEG. 3) Additional information coming from other modalities is usually available and can be incorporated. The authors are illustrating these important points in the case of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity. Spike averaging, frequency domain source localization, and temporal segmentation based on electric field topographies will be discussed. Finally, the technique of EEG-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be illustrated, where EEG is recorded in the magnet and is used to synchronize fMRI acquisition with interictal events. The analysis of both functional data, i.e. the EEG in terms of three-dimensional source localization and the EEG-triggered fMRI, combines the advantages of the two techniques: the temporal resolution of the EEG and the spatial resolution of the fMRI.<p>

<li>Kno?sche TR, Maeß B, Friederici AD: Processing of syntactic information monitored by brain surface current density mapping based on meg. Brain Topography 1999;12:75-87.<p>
Summary: The cortical network subserving language processing is likely to exhibit a high spatial and temporal complexity. Studies using brain imaging methods, like fMRI or PET, succeeded in identifying a number of brain structures that seem to contribute to the processing of syntactic structures, while their dynamic interaction remains unclear due to the low temporal resolution of the methods. On the other hand, ERP studies have revealed a great deal of the temporal dimension of language processing without being able to provide more than very coarse information on the localisation of the underlying generators. MEG has a temporal resolution similar to EEG combined with a better spatial resolution. In this paper, Brain Surface Current Density (BSCD) mapping in a standard brain model was used to identify statistically significant differences between the activity of certain brain regions due to syntactically correct and incorrect auditory language input. The results show that the activity in the first 600 ms after violation onset is mainly concentrated in the temporal cortex and the adjacent frontal and parietal areas of both hemispheres. The statistical analysis reveals significantly different activity mainly in both frontal and temporal cortices. For longer latencies above 250 ms, the differential activity is more prominent in the right hemisphere. These findings confirm other recent results that suggest right hemisphere involvement in auditory language processing. One interpretation might be that right hemisphere regions play an important role in repair and re-analysis processes in order to free the specialised left hemisphere language areas for processing further input.<p>

Summary: For the study of functional organization and reorganization of the human cortex by means of electromagnetic source imaging, a measure of the location and spatial extent of neural sources is of interest. This study evaluates the cortical patch method (CPM), an iterative procedure introduced by Lutkenhoner et al. [1995] that models EEG/MEG activity by means of extended cortical patches. Anatomical information is used to constrain estimates of location and extent of neural sources that generate the measured evoked potential. Whereas minimum norm approaches use mathematical constraints to solve the ambiguity of the inverse problem, the CPM introduces constraints based on anatomical and physiological knowledge about neural mass activity. In order to test the proposed method, the simulated activity in an artificial sulcus was subjected to the CPM. The results show that even activity on opposing walls of a sulcus can be well reconstructed. The simulations demonstrate the usefulness and limits of the CPM in estimating the spatial extent of neural sources in the cerebral cortex. As an example, an application of the method on experimental somatosensory evoked potentials is presented in the Appendix.<p>

Summary: There is an ongoing debate in cognitive neuroscience about the time course and the functional independence of the different processes involved in encoding written language material. New data indicate very fast and highly parallel language analysis networks in the brain. Here we demonstrate a methodological approach to study the temporal dynamics of this network by searching for time periods where different task demands emphasize different aspects of the network. Multi-channel event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a semantic and a phonological reading task from 14 healthy subjects. Signals were analyzed exclusively on the basis of the spatial configuration of the electric potential distributions (ERP maps), since differences in these spatial patterns directly reflect changes in the configuration of the active sources in the brain. This analysis did not reveal any differences of the evoked brain electric fields between the two tasks up to 280 ms post-stimulus. The ERP maps then differed for a brief period between 280 and 380 ms, before they were similar again. The analysis of the maps using a global linear localization procedure revealed a network of areas, active in both tasks, that mainly involved the left postero-temporal and left antero-temporal regions. The left posterior activation was found already around 100 ms post-stimulus, indicating that language-specific functions appear early in time. We therefore conclude that phonological and semantic processing are essentially performed in both tasks and that only late decision-related processes influence the relative strength of activity of the different modules in the complex language network.<p>

<li>Hughes JR, John ER: Conventional and quantitative electroencephalography in psychiatry. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 1999;11:190-208.<p>
Summary: Electrical activity of each brain region is homeostatically regulated, resulting in predictable frequency composition of the background EEG. Replicated normative databases have established that the EEG power spectrum is independent of ethnic backgrounds. Artifact-free EEG evaluated relative to such norms displays few deviant values in healthy, normally functioning individuals. In subjects with psychiatric disorders, high proportions of abnormal findings have been reported with good concordance and high specificity and sensitivity across numerous studies, distinctive within a wide variety of disorders and often contributing to differential diagnosis and selection of treatment. New three-dimensional QEEG imaging methods offer an economical alternative to other functional brain imaging modalities.<p>

<li>Han S, Fan S, Chen L, Zhuo Y: Modulation of brain activities by hierarchical processing: A high-density erp study. Brain Topography 1999;11:171-183.<p>
Summary: The present study investigated how attention to global or local levels of hierarchical patterns modulates brain activities by recording high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by hierarchical stimuli. 120-channel recordings of ERPs were obtained from subjects while they detected targets at global or local levels of hierarchical stimuli displayed in the left or the right visual field. We found that attention to local stimulus features enhanced posterior P1 and N2 components, with the N2 enhancement showing a left hemisphere predominance regardless of stimulus positions. Difference was also seen in the distribution of the frontal P2. Reaction times were slowed when global and local levels of stimuli were incompatible, and an interference effect was observed on anterior N2 amplitudes and latencies. Three-dimensional current distributions showed common sources over the posterior cortex between 80-230 ms and a contralateral frontal source between 300-400 ms for global and local conditions. However, an additional ipsilateral frontal focus between 230-350 ms was found specially for local processing. The results corroborate the findings of previous ERP studies, and suggest that the frontal lobe is particularly important for the selective processing of local parts of a global structure.<p>

Summary: Minimum norm algorithms for EEG source reconstruction are studied in view of their spatial resolution, regularization, and lead-field normalization properties, and their computational efforts. Two classes of minimum norm solutions are examined: linear least squares methods and nonlinear L1-norm approaches. Two special cases of linear algorithms, the well known Minimum Norm Least Squares and an implementation with Laplacian smoothness constraints, are compared to two nonlinear algorithms comprising sparse and standard L1-norm methods. In a signal-to-noise-ratio framework, two of the methods allow automatic determination of the optimum regularization parameter. Compensation methods for the different depth dependencies of all approaches by lead-field normalization are discussed. Simulations with tangentially and radially oriented test dipoles at two different noise levels are performed to reveal and compare the properties of all approaches. Finally, cortically constrained versions of the algorithms are applied to two epileptic spike data sets and compared to results of single equivalent dipole fits and spatiotemporal source models.<p>

Summary: In routine clinical EEG, a common origin is assumed for delta and theta rhythms produced by brain lesions. In previous papers, we have provided some experimental support, based on High Resolution qEEG and dipole fitting in the frequency domain, for the hypothesis that delta and theta spectral power have independent origins related to lesion and edema respectively. This paper describes the results obtained with Frequency Domain VARETA (FD-VARETA) in a group of 13 patients with cortical space-occupying lesions, in order to: 1) Test the accuracy of FD-VARETA for the localization of brain lesions, and 2) To provide further support for the independent origin of delta and theta components. FD VARETA is a distributed inverse solution, constrained by the Montreal Neurological institute probabilistic atlas that estimates the spectra of EEG sources. In all patients, logarithmic transformed source spectra were compared with age-matched normative values, defining the Z source spectrum. Maximum Z values were found in 10 patients within the delta band (1.56 to 3.12 Hz); the spatial extent of these sources in the atlas corresponded with the location of the tumors in the C T. In 2 patients with small metastases and large volumes of edema and in a patient showing only edema, maximum Z values were found between 4.29 and 5.12 Hz. The spatial extent of the sources at these frequencies was within the volume of the edema in the CT. These results provided strong support to the hypothesis that both delta and theta abnormal EEG activities are the counterparts of two different pathophysiological processes.<p>

<li>Fallgatter AJ, Strik WK: The nogo-anteriorization as a neurophysiological standard-index for cognitive response control. International Journal of Psychophysiology 1999;32:233-238.<p>
Summary: Event related potentials (ERPs) during the Go- and the NoGo-condition of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) were applied to investigate the neurophysiological basis of cognitive response control. These conditions of the test represent the execution and the inhibition of an anticipated motor response. In a previous study, the comprehensive spatial analysis of the ERPs allowed to define a parameter which robustly reflected the anteriorization of the positive P300 field area during the NoGo- compared to the Go-condition (NoGo-anteriorisation, NGA). The result was found consistently in all investigated subjects. The present study replicated the finding in 27 healthy subjects without any exception. Moreover, the latencies were longer and the amplitudes showed a trend to be higher in the NoGo- compared to the Go-ERP. This is interpreted as a sign of higher processing demands in the NoGo-condition. In conclusion, the ability of the NGA to express reliably the differences of brain activity leading to execution or suppression of a prepared motor response qualifies this parameter as a topographical standard-index for cognitive response control.<p>

<li>Fallgatter AJ, Mueller TJ, Strik WK: Age-related changes in the brain electrical correlates of response control. Clinical Neurophysiology 1999;110:833-838.<p>
Summary: Objectives: Previously, a quantification method was validated which, on a single case basis, allows one to assess the NoGo-anteriorisation (NGA) of the positive area of long latency event-related potential (ERP) fields elicited by a cued continuous performance test (CPT). The NGA was shown to be associated with right frontal activity. The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of age and gender on this topographical index of cognitive response control. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy controls were investigated with 21-channel recordings during the execution of a cued CPT, and ERPs of the Go and NoGo condition were obtained. The location of the positive area centroids in a P300 range and the NGA were calculated and related to age and gender by means of correlation analysis and t tests. Results: The centroid locations of the brain electrical activity during the NoGo- and the Go-condition of the CPT, were both located in more anterior brain regions with increasing age (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.1, respectively); the NGA, however, was not correlated with the subject's age. Latencies and amplitudes of the Go- and NoGo-centroids were not correlated with age. No gender differences were found. Conclusions: The study showed that age is a source of variance for the positive area centroid locations in this Go-NoGo paradigm. The NGA, on the other hand, was robust to age and gender effects. The result is interpreted as a sign of an increasing contribution of frontal brain areas to cognitive response control during lifespan. The finding is consistent with the age-related topographical changes described in acoustic oddball-paradigms and, therefore, appears to be a general topographical ERP effect.<p>

Summary: The prefrontal cortex participates in motor control and is modulated by serotonergic activity. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a major regulator of serotonergic neurotransmission and may thus influence motor control. The short allele(s) of the 5-HTT linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is associated with less 5-HTT expression and function than the long variant (I). The neurophysiological parameters termed 'Go- and NoGo-centroid location' represent characteristic brain electrical substrates of the execution and inhibition of motor response elicited by the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). In the present study, the impact of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on the centroid locations was investigated in 23 healthy subjects. The NoGo-centroid, but not the Go-centroid, was located significantly more anteriorly in the short allele group (mean electrode location in s/s and s/l, 2.86 ± 0.37) compared to the group with two long alleles (l/l 3.34 ± 0.49; t = 2.66, p &lt; 0.05). Age, gender, and test performance did not differ between groups. The results indicate that 5-HTTLPR genotype dependent 5-HTT function is associated with the neurophysiologically assessed topography of inhibitory motor control and provides further evidence for a genetic influence on central serotonergic and motor function.<p>

Summary: This investigation was designed to study the characteristics of a marker for harmonic processing and to test whether it could be used for differentiating harmonic processing capabilities. The first three chords of an ordinary musical cadenca were presented to the left ear to establish a harmonic context followed by a harmonic or non-harmonic target tone. Cadencas were presented rapidly and randomly in different keys to render the task difficult. Results showed a specific P3m (magnetic P300) effect to the non-harmonic targets which was only visible in subjects with low target recognition errors. Low resolution electro-magnetic tomography current density maps showed P3m sources in the right temporoparietal, left temporoparietal and frontocentral brain areas with right temporoparietal sources being strongest and most reliable. The results offer new possibilities to selectively study harmonic variables in music processing. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.<p>

<li>Alper KR: The eeg and cocaine sensitization: A hypothesis. Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 1999;11:209-221.<p>
Summary: The author presents the hypothesis that reduced delta EEG power observed in cocaine withdrawal is related to changes in dopamine (DA) transmission related to cocaine sensitization. Evidence for this hypothesis includes the topographic anatomical correspondence between the putative site of delta generation and the cortical terminal field of the mesotelencephalic DA system, as well as the laminar distribution and ultrastructural features of DA terminals in frontal cortex that appear to be adapted to the modulation of the delta rhythm, a global forebrain EEG mode. The effect of DA on membrane conductances of individual pyramidal neurons also suggests that DA exerts a significant influence on delta power by modulating the transition between global and local EEG modes. Access to a neural correlate of sensitization via non-invasive EEG methodology could be useful in investigating the relationship of stimulant sensitization to the clinical syndrome of cocaine dependence.<p>

Summary: During the last decade multiple work has been done to determine the sources of epileptiform activity by means of dipole source localization based on recordings of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) or the electroencephalogram (EEG). The actual available advanced volume conductor models and the multiple source reconstruction by regularization may give new impulse to EEG based source analyses in epilepsy patients. This study demonstrates the principal properties of these techniques. We applied two different EEG source reconstruction techniques within different volume conductor models to localize induced spike activity in a selected patient suffering from medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy: 1) single moving dipole solution in a 3-shell spherical model versus individual head models (boundary-element-model, BEM, and finite-element-model, FEM); 2) a regularization technique for current density reconstructions using both BEM and FEM. When compared to findings of invasive recordings no adequate source locations were derived from the moving dipole solution in both the 3-shell head model and BEM. In contrast, a high congruence of source reconstruction and invasive determination of the focus was obtained using the regularization techniques in both BEM and FEM, indicating the high spatial accuracy of this technique in individual head models.<p>

Behavioural Brain Research 1998;94:97-110.<p>
Summary: A total of 11 children with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and nine control children performed a continuous performance test (CPT) of the A-X type with concurrent neuroelectric brain mapping to assess preparatory processing, purportedly mediated by the frontal lobes. This cued CPT task proved to be a highly specific task. The groups could be clearly differentiated both at the behavioral and electrophysiological level. ADD children detected fewer signals and made more false alarms. There were no major group differences in topographical distribution of the event-related potential microstates, but ADD children displayed reduced global field power (GFP) in an early CNV/P3 microstate to cues. This indicated that impaired orienting to cues, rather than impaired executive target processing, determines the initial processing stages in ADD. In comparison with data from the same task run in Utrecht, the same orienting deficit in clinically diagnosed ADHD children was demonstrated. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) estimated posterior sources underlying these orienting processes and the orienting deficit. This argued against frontal lobe involvement at this stage and suggested involvement of a posterior attention system.<p>

Summary: Objectives: Spatial analysis of the evoked brain electrical fields during a cued continuous performance test (CPT) revealed an extremely robust anteriorization of the positivity of a P300 microstate in the NoGo compared to the Go condition (NoGo-anteriorization in a previous study). To allow a neuroanatomical interpretation the NoGo-anteriorization was investigated with a new three-dimensional source tomography method (LORETA) was applied. Methods: The CPT contains subsets of stimuli requiring the execution (Go) or the inhibition (NoGo) of a cued motor response which can be considered as mutual control conditions for the event-related potential (ERP) study of inhibitory brain functions 21-channel ERPs were obtained from 10 healthy subjects during a cued CPT, and analyzed with LORETA. Results: Topographic analyses revealed significantly different scalp distributions between the Go and the NoGo conditions in both P100 and P300 microstates, indicating that already at an early stage different neural assemblies are activated. LORETA disclosed a significant hyperactivity located in the right frontal lobe during the NoGo condition in the P300 microstate. Conclusions: The results indicate that right frontal sources are responsible for the NoGo- anteriorization of the scalp P300 which is consistent with animal and human lesion studies of inhibitory brain functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that frontal activation is confined to a brief microstate and time-locked to phasic inhibitory motor control. This adds important functional and chronometric specificity to findings of frontal activation obtained with PET and Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy studies during the cued CPT, and suggests that these metabolic results are not due to general task demands.<p>

Summary: We studied the topographic relationships between cortical and subcortical lesions shown on magnetic resonance images (MRI) and sources of epileptiform activity in a series of nine children with intractable epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex. Although video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was suggestive of the frontal seizure onset, interictal EEG was, in seven of nine cases, in the form of apparently bisychronous discharges. In all cases, the use of a short time lag estimation procedure based on a nonlinear procedure correlation functin between surface recorded EEG signal allowed the detection of a lateralized onset of EEG paroxysmal activity. Furthermore, a computerized method based on a source localization EEG-MRI image fusioning procedure, has revealed a topographic concordance between well-defined frontal cortical lesions shown on MRI and site of onset of paroxysmal discharges. Lennox-like EEG patterns frequently reported in children with tuberous sclerosis complex could be the result of the tendency of frontal tubers to induce secondary bilateral synchrony, with implications in the medical and eventually surgical management of the often drug-resistant associated seizures.<p>

Summary: Objectives: Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) is an epileptic syndrome characterised by a deficit in language comprehension and production, paroxysmal epileptiform activity in the posterior temporal leads, and by the inconsistent presence of epileptic fits. Its interest lies in the fact that it stands as a model for the study of interference of epileptiform activity on cognitive function, although the pathophysiology of the decline in language skills that follows its onset has not yet been clarified. Methods: We have recorded spike-triggered auditory evoked responses in a group of 6 children with LKS, to investigate whether the occurrence of individual EEG paroxysms is able per se to induce a decline in the response of the auditory cortex. Results: Results have indicated that left hemisphere spikes are associated with a greater reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency of the N1, than spikes occurring in the right hemisphere. No stable change in the evoked response has been detected outside of the EEG paroxysm. Conclusions: We postulate EEG interictal activity is able to induce impairment in processing auditory information and that this may play a role in the pathogenesis of language deficit in LKS.<p>

Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology 1998;106:508-512.<p>
Summary: We present a new approach for non-invasive localization of focal epileptogenic discharges in patients considered for surgical treatment. EEG- triggered functional MR imaging (fMRI) and 3D EEG source localization were combined to map the primary electrical source with high spatial resolution. The method is illustrated by the case of a patient with medically intractable frontal lobe epilepsy. EEG obtained in the MRI system allowed triggering of the fMRI acquisition by the patient's habitual epileptogenic discharges. fMRI revealed multiple areas of signal enhancement. Three-dimensional EEG source localization identified the same active areas and provided evidence of onset in the left frontal lobe. Subsequent electrocorticography from subdural electrodes confirmed spike and seizure onset over this region. This approach, i.e. the combination of EEG-triggered fMRI and 3D EEG source analysis, represents a promising additional tool for presurgical epilepsy evaluation allowing precise non-invasive identification of the epileptic foci.<p>

<li>Riera JJ, Fuentes ME, Valde?s PA, Oha?rriz Y: Eeg-distributed inverse solutions for a spherical head model. Inverse Problems 1998;14:1009-1019.<p>
Summary: The theoretical study of the minimum norm solution to the MEG inverse problem has been carried out in previous papers for the particular case of spherical symmetry. However, a similar study for the EEG is remarkably more difficult due to the very complicated nature of the expression relating the voltage differences on the scalp to the primary current density (PCD) even for this simple symmetry. This paper introduces the use of the electric lead field (ELF) on the dyadic formalism in the spherical coordinate system to overcome such a drawback using an expansion of the ELF in terms of longitudinal and orthogonal vector fields. This approach allows us to represent EEG Fourier coefficients on a 2-sphere in terms of a current multipole expansion. The choice of a suitable basis for the Hubert space of the PCDs on the brain region allows the current multipole moments to be related by spatial transfer functions to the PCD spectral coefficients. Properties of the most used distributed inverse solutions are explored on the basis of these results. Also, a part of the ELF null space is completely characterized and those spherical components of the PCD which are possible silent candidates are discussed.<p>

Summary: Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from the scalp of subjects who attended to a flickering LED display in one visual field while ignoring a similar display (flickering at a different frequency) in the opposite visual field. The flicker frequencies were 20.8 Hz in the left-field display and 27.8 Hz in the right-field display. The SSVEP to the flicker in either field was enhanced in amplitude when attention was directed to its location. The scalp distribution of this SSVEP enhancement was narrowly focused over the posterior scalp contralateral to the visual field of stimulation. A source analysis using Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (VARETA) indicated that the source current densities for the SSVEP attention effect had a focal origin in the contralateral parieto-occipital cortex.<p>

Summary: Cues designating one of two possible tasks preceded a target requiring a discriminative button-press response. The two tasks occurred randomly so that on each trial the subject either repeated the task from the previous trial or switched to the other task. Bi-occipital (N200), parietal (P390) and fronto-central (N430) event related potentials (ERPs) to the cue stimulus were larger for switch than repeat tasks. These results suggest that both posterior and frontal cortices participate in switching. The N200, P390, and N430 may reflect perceptual (stimulus), conceptual, and response-set shifting, respectively.<p>

Summary: For the sake of realism in the description of conduction from primary neural currents to scalp potentials, we investigated the influence of skull anisotropy on the forward and inverse problems in brain functional imaging with EEG. At present, all methods available for cortical imaging assume a spherical geometry, or when using realistic head shapes do not consider the anisotropy of head tissues. However, to our knowledge, no study relates the implication of this simplifying hypothesis on the spatial resolution of EEG for source imaging. In this paper, a method using finite elements in a realistic head geometry is implemented and validated. The influence of erroneous conductivity values for the head tissues is presented, and results show that the conductivities of the brain and the skull in the radial orientation are the most critical ones. In the inverse problem, this influence has been evaluated with simulations using a distributed source model with a comparison of two regularization techniques, with the isotropic model working on data sets produced by a nonisotropic model. Regularization with minimum norm priors produces source images with spurious activity, meaning that the errors in the head model totally annihilate any localization ability. But nonlinear regularization allows the accurate recovery of simultaneous spots of activity, while the restoration of very close active regions is profoundly disabled by errors in the head model. We conclude that for robust cortical source imaging with EEG, a realistic head model taking anisotropy of tissues into account should be used.<p>

Summary: The goal of our research is to develop an experimental and analytical framework for spatiotemporal imaging of human brain function. Preliminary studies suggest that noninvasive spatiotemporal maps of cerebral activity can be produced by combining the high spatial resolution (millimeters) of functional MRI (fMRI) with the high temporal resolution (milliseconds) of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Although MEG and EEG are sensitive to millisecond changes in mental activity, the ability to resolve source localization and timing is limited by the ill-posed 'inverse' problem. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the use of MRI constraints in a linear estimation inverse procedure, where fMRI weighting, cortical location and orientation, and sensor noise statistics were realistically incorporated. An error metric was computed to quantify the effects of fMRI invisible ('missing') sources, 'extra' fMRI sources, and cortical orientation errors. Our simulation results demonstrate that prior anatomical and functional information from MRI can be used to regularize the EEG/MEG inverse problem, giving an improved solution with high spatial and temporal resolution. An fMRI weighting of approximately 90% was determined to provide the best compromise between separation of activity from correctly localized sources and minimization of error caused by missing sources. The accuracy of the estimate was relatively independent of the number and extent of the sources, allowing for incorporation of physiologically realistic multiple distributed sources. This linear estimation method provides an operator-independent approach for combining information from fMRI, MEG, and EEG and represents a significant advance over traditional dipole modeling.<p>

<li>Koles ZJ: Trends in eeg source localization. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology 1998;106:127-137.<p>
Summary: The concepts underlying the quantitative localization of the sources of the EEG inside the brain are reviewed along with the current and emerging approaches to the problem. The concepts mentioned include monopolar and dipolar source models and head models ranging from the spherical to the more realistic based on boundary and finite elements. The forward and inverse problems in electroencephalography are discussed, including the non- uniqueness of the inverse problem. The approaches to the solution of the inverse problem described include single and multiple time-slice localization, equivalent dipole localization and the weighted minimum norm. The multiple time-slice localization approach is highlighted as probably the best available at this time and is discussed in terms of the spatiotemporal model of the EEG. The effect of noise corruption, artifacts and the number of recording electrodes on the accuracy of source localization is also mentioned. It is suggested that the main appeal of the minimum norm is that it does not assume a model for the sources and provides an estimate of the current density everywhere in the three dimensional volume of the head.<p>

Summary: Theoretical, methodological and methodical aspects on nonstationary EEGs, that is, EEGs whose patterns undergo changes with time are reviewed. The piecewise description of the EEG is confirmed on the base of the own data and results of another investigators. It is analysed the basic approach to statistical evaluation of nonstationary EEGs in the terms of quasi-stationary segments. The special attention is devoted tho the data of segmental organization of the bioelectrical field of the cortex. Taking into consideration new experimental data concerning the time consistence of the segmental descriptions of regional EEGs it is suggested conception of &quot;operational synchrony&quot; as a form of discretial cooperation of cortex process. The theoretical explanations of the phenomenology for pies-wise functioning of neuron nets are discussed.<p>

Summary: In the auditory modality, there has been a considerable debate about some aspects of cortical disorders, especially about auditory forms of agnosia. Agnosia refers to an impaired comprehension of sensory information in the absence of deficits in primary sensory processes. In the non-verbal domain, sound agnosia and amusia have been reported but are frequently accompanied by language deficits whereas pure deficits are rare. Absolute pitch and musicians' musical abilities have been associated with left hemispheric functions. We report the case of a right handed sound engineer with the absolute pitch who developed sound agnosia and amusia in the absence of verbal deficits after a right perisylvian stroke. His disabilities were assessed with the Seashore Test of Musical Functions, the tests of Wertheim and Botez and by event-related potentials (ERP) recorded in a modified 'oddball paradigm'. Auditory ERP revealed a dissociation between the amplitudes of the P3a and P3b subcomponents with the P3b being reduced in amplitude while the P3a was undisturbed. This is interpreted as reflecting disturbances in target detection processes as indexed by the P3b. The findings that contradict some aspects of current knowledge about left/right hemispheric specialization in musical processing are discussed and related to the literature concerning cortical auditory disorders.<p>

Summary: Children with attention deficit disorders (ADD) may have specific problems with response inhibition in the STOP task. This task requires that subjects stop responses to a primary task if a second signal follows. However, it is unclear whether these problems reflect an impairment of the stopping process per se, whether they are related to reduced frontal lobe activation and whether they are confined to severe and pervasive forms of ADD. In 11 ADD and nine control children, 32 channel event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) were recorded in a STOP and a delayed GO task. Mapping revealed that both tasks evoked a similar sequence of neuroelectric microstates, i.e. of time segments with stable map topography. Adaptive segmentation identified the transition between these microstates. Reliable group differences were found in several microstates and in both tasks despite matched performance. In the GO task, ADD children had topographically altered P2/N2 microstates and attenuated P300-type microstates. In the STOP task, a topographically altered N1 microstate which coincided with the onset of the stop signal preceded the stop failures of ADD children. The timing of this microstate is too early to reflect deficits in actual stop signal processing and instead suggests altered initial orienting of attention to the primary signal in ADD children. Imaging with low resolution tomography (LORETA) during this microstate to stop failures indicated mainly posterior activation for both groups and increased rather than reduced frontal activation in ADD children. For a later microstate (P550), LORETA indicated strong frontal activation after successful stopping, but no group differences. The results suggest that information processing of ADD children deviates during activation of posterior mechanisms which may be related to the orienting of attention and which precedes and partly determines inhibitory control problems in ADD.<p>

Summary: Mapping of cognitive evoked scalp potentials (EPs) offers excellent temporal and cognitive resolution. Its spatial resolution distinguishes even subtle differences in afferent and cognitive processes and is commonly underestimated. The noninvasive method reveals a temporally ordered sequence of transient, covert, functional microstates of the brain. Tomographic and gradient-based source localization can translate this spatial into neuroanatomical resolution which depends on the three-dimensional configuration of the active sources. Such functional brain map ping with EPs has the potential to integrate current structural (neurological) and dynamic (information processing) models of brain function and dysfunction. We review contributions to a neurophysiological understanding of language, attention, inhibition, and of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders).<p>

Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology 1998;108:160-174.<p>
Summary: The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is considered to be closely related to cognitive processes. In normal aging, P300 scalp latencies increase, parietal P300 scalp amplitudes decrease and the scalp potential field shifts to a relatively more frontal distribution. Based on ERPs recorded in 172 normal healthy subjects aged between 20 and 88 years in an auditory oddball paradigm, the effects of age on the electrical activity in the brain corresponding to Nl and P300 components were estimated by means of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). This distributed approach directly computes a unique 3-dimensional electrical source distribution by assuming that neighbouring neurons are simultaneously and synchronously active. Nl LORETA generators, located predominantly in both auditory cortices and also symmetrically in prefrontal areas, increased with advancing age for standards but remained stable for targets. P300 LORETA generators, located symmetrically in the prefrontal cortex, in the parieto-occipital junction and in the inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus) and medially in the superior parietal cortex, were differentially affected by age. While age did not affect parieto-occipital sources, superior parietal and right prefrontal sources decreased pronouncedly. Thus, in normal aging, P300 current density decreased in regions were a fronto-parietal network for sustained attention was localized. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.<p>

<li>Zeitlhofer J, Gruber G, Anderer P, Asenbaum S, Schimicek P, Saletu B: Topographic distribution of sleep spindles in young healthy subjects. Journal of Sleep Research 1997;6:149-155.<p>
Summary: The application of an automatic sleep spindle detection procedure allowed the documentation of the topographic distribution of spindle characteristics, such as number, amplitude, frequency and duration, as a function of sleep depth and of recording time. Multichannel all-night EEG recordings were performed in 10 normal healthy subjects aged 20-35 years. Although the interindividual variability in the number of sleep spindles was very high (2.7 ± 2.1 spindles per minute stage 2 sleep), all but two subjects showed maximal spindle activity in centro-parietal midline leads. Moreover, this topography was seen in all sleep stages and changed only slightly - to a more central distribution - towards the end of the night. On the other hand, slow (11.5-14 Hz) and fast (14-16 Hz) spindles showed a completely different topography, with slow spindles distributed anteriorly and fast spindles centro-parietally. The number of sleep spindles per min was significant depending on sleep stages, with the expected highest occurrence in stage 2, and on recording time, with a decrease in spindle density from the beginning towards the end of the night. However, spindle amplitude, frequency and individual duration was not influenced by sleep depth or time of the night.<p>

Summary: The brain topography of EEG power spectra in the frequency range of sleep spindles was investigated in 34 sleep recordings from 20 healthy young men. Referential (F3-A2, C3-A2, P3-A2 and O1-A2) and bipolar derivations (F3- C3, C3-P3 and P3-O1) along the anteroposterior axis were used. Sleep spindles gave rise to a distinct peak in the EEG power spectrum. The distribution of the peak frequencies pooled over subjects and derivations showed a bimodal pattern with modes at 11.5 and 13.0 Hz, and a trough at 12.25 Hz. The large intersubject variation in peak frequency (range: 1.25 Hz) contrasted with the small intra-subject variation between derivations, non-REM sleep episodes and different nights. In some individuals and/or some derivations, only a single spindle peak was present. The topographic distributions from referential and bipolar recordings showed differences. The power showed a declining trend over consecutive non-REM sleep episodes in the low range of spindle frequency activity and a rising trend in the high range. The functional and topographic heterogeneity of sleep spindles in conjunction with the intra-subject stability of their frequency are important characteristics for the analysis of sleep regulation on the basis of the EEG.<p>

<li>Werth E, Achermann P, Borbe?ly AA: Fronto-occipital eeg power gradients in human sleep. Journal of Sleep Research 1997;6:102-112.<p>
Summary: The brain topography of power spectra along the antero-posterior (A-P) axis was studied in the all-night human sleep EEG. Spectra (0.25-25.0 Hz) were computed for an anterior (A; F3-C3), a middle (M; C3-P3) and a posterior (P; P3-01) bipolar derivation, and the spectral gradients between two adjacent derivations were expressed by power ratios (A/M and M/P). At NREM-REM sleep transitions a power shift from A to M was present over almost the entire frequency range, while the direction of shifts between M and P differed between frequency bands. Within NREM sleep, frequency specific power gradients were present: In the low delta band power in both A (0.25 Hz bin) and P (0.25-1.0 Hz bins) was higher than in M. In the 4-9 Hz range the relation was A&gt;M&gt;P, and in the 15-25 Hz range power was largest in M. Power in the spindle frequency range was highest at 11.75 Hz in M, and at 13.5-13.75 Hz in A. Topographical differences were seen also in the temporal changes of power across and within NREM sleep episodes. Whereas NREM sleep power in the 2-Hz bin was higher in A than in M in the first episode, this difference vanished in the course of the night. This result points to a specific involvement of frontal parts of the cortex in sleep homeostasis. The regional differences in sleep EEG spectra indicate that sleep is not only a global phenomenon but also a local brain process with a different regional involvement of neuronal populations.<p>

Summary: On the basis of spatial covariance, it is found that, by spatial filtering the localisation of a single dipole source, both parallel and perpendicular to the measurement plane (assuming a signal-noise ratio of 5:1), can be performed with an accuracy of &lt; 0.5 mm. When the signal-noise ratio is increased to 30:1, the resolution of temporally independent current sources separated by 2 mm becomes practicable. This resolution study is carried out by means of a pair of unity current dipoles with the dipole distance as a varying source model parameter. The conclusions, drawn from the results of computer simulation and supported by statistical calculations, refer to the spherical model of the volume conductor of the brain.

Summary: The mathematical basis of signal-space projection (SSP) method was related to other comparable methods and the accuracy of the method was analyzed. Projection operators were constructed to divide the electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into two parts. Errors were inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio and sin ?. The directions of the signals, the locations and orientations of the dipoles included in the projection operator were assumed to be known. The error ?? in knowing the exact directions in the signal space caused additional noise in the analysis. The angle ? between component vectors determined the separability of the two sources.<p>

Summary: We describe a new approach to imaging neural current sources from measurements of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) associated with sensory, motor, or cognitive brain activation. Many previous approaches to this problem have concentrated on the use of weighted minimum norm (WMN) inverse methods. While these methods ensure a unique solution, they do not introduce information specific to the MEG inverse problem, often producing overly smoothed solutions and exhibiting severe sensitivity to noise. We describe a Bayesian formulation of the inverse problem in which a Gibbs prior is constructed to reflect the sparse focal nature of neural current sources associated with evoked response data. We demonstrate the method with simulated and experimental phantom data, comparing its performance with several WMN methods. © 1997 IEEE.<p>

Summary: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded as German-speaking subjects read verbs in correct and incorrect participle forms. The critical words were presented in three different versions to three different groups of subjects, as part of a simple sentence, in a word list, and embedded in a story; for each version separate ERPs were recorded. Three types of verbs were investigated, regulars, irregulars and nonce verbs. We compared correct regular and irregular participles with incorrect ones; the latter had -(e)n on verbs that actually take -t participles (*getanz-en), or -(e)t on verbs that require -(e)n (*gelad-et). For the nonce verbs, we compared participles with the unexpected -(e)n ending with the expected -t participle forms. The ERP responses were very consistent across the three versions of the experiment: (i) incorrect irregular participles (* gelad-et) elicited a left frontotemporal negativity; (ii) incorrect regulars (* getanz-en) produced no differences to the correct ones; (iii) nonce verbs were associated with an N400 component but did not show a difference between expected and unexpected endings. We will interpret these findings with respect to psycholinguistic models of morphological processing and argue that the brain processes regularly inflected words differently from irregularly inflected ones, the latter by accessing full-form entries stored in memory and the former by a computational process that decomposes complex words into stems and affixes.<p>

Summary: Evidence from functional brain imaging studies suggests that mental imagery processes, like other higher cognitive functions, simultaneously activate different neuronal networks involving multiple cortical areas. The question of whether these different areas are truly simultaneously active or whether they are temporally distinct and might reflect different steps of information processing cannot be answered by these imaging methods. We applied spatiotemporal analysis techniques to multichannel event-related potential (ERP) recordings in order to elucidate the topography and chronology of brain processes involved in mental rotation. We measured 41- electrode ERPs in 12 healthy subjects who had to evaluate whether rotated letters were in a normal or mirror-reflected position. These figures were presented in the left, right, or central visual fields and were randomly rotated by 0°, 50°, 100°, or 150°. Behaviorally, we replicated the observation that reaction time increases with greater angles of rotation. Electrophysiologically, we identified a set of dominant electric potential distributions, each of them stable for a certain time period. Only one of these time segments (appearing between 400-600 msec) increased significantly in duration with greater angles of rotation mirroring reaction time. We suggest that the rotation of mental images is carried out during this time segment. A general linear inverse solution applied to this segment showed occipito-parietal cerebral activity that was lateralized to the right hemisphere.<p>

<li>Merica H, Blois R, Fortune RD, Gaillard JM: Evolution of delta activity within the nonrem sleep episode: A biphasic hypothesis. Physiology and Behavior 1997;62:213-219.<p>
Summary: The time course of delta activity within nonREM (NREM) episodes is measured for 24 healthy subjects with normal REM latencies. The first two NREM episodes in particular, show two very clearly separated peaks for about 35% of the subjects. Another 25% show two less well separated peaks. These double peak patterns are also prevalent in the literature, but there has been a tendency to dismiss them as a skipped REM effect. They are, however, still evident even when the data are averaged over the 24 subjects, indicating a systematic phenomenon. These averaged data are well fitted by an analytic function given by the sum of two consecutive overlapping Gaussian curves. The well-behaved residuals also, are an indication that a biphasic model of this kind is statistically appropriate. The model proposed is simple, with parameters related to physiological phenomena, and it suggests that there may be an underlying process with delta waves emanating from two separate signal sources. Recent neurophysiological findings suggest that delta oscillations are generated both in the thalamus and in the cortex and show that excessive synchronization of slow oscillations may lead to seizures. Hence the speculation that the biphasic process may emnanate from cortical and thalamic sources and be protective in the sense that it permits smaller delta amplitudes at each source while retaining the integral delta energy necessary to satisfy sleep pressure. It is significant that the two peaks are most evident in the first two NREM episodes where delta power is high.<p>

Summary: Besides the standard clinical methods of EEG waveshape analysis, mathematical models for reconstruction of dipolar sources from the digitized surface EEG have been introduced in epilepsy research. Although useful for localizing focal sources, these methods are inadequate for analyzing widespread epileptiform activity. A recently introduced alternative method called LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography, Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994), directly computes the current distribution throughout the full brain volume, assuming thai neighboring neuronal populations are simultaneously and synchronously activated. In mathematical terms the method selects the smoothest of all possible 3-dimensional current distributions, inherently introducing a certain amount of dispersion. In 7 patients, undergoing simultaneous EEG recording from 10 intracranial (subdural) and 22 extracranial electrodes, III subdural discharges (61 subtemporal and 50 lateral temporal) were identified. The exact time point of maximal intracranial activity was automatically identified, and the LORETA solution at that timepoint was computed from the surface EEG. Statistical comparison revealed significantly higher LORETA current density in the area corresponding to the subdurally recorded spike compared to other areas, and a more anterior and more medial LORETA location for subtemporal compared to lateral temporal spikes. This study indicates that the LORETA technique may become a useful method to localize electrical activity in the brain.<p>

Summary: Objective: Determine the generator sources for actual and imagined (simulated) movements of fingers and toes. Design: Observational Setting: Electroencephalography laboratory. Subjects: Ten asymptomatic adult volunteers. Main Outcome Measure: Comparison of cortical electrical fields and their dipole sources in actual and imagined movements. Results: Cortical electrical fields tend to be contralateral with actual movements and midline with imagined movements. Dipole sources of actual movements include a contralateral contribution from the frontal (primary motor) area. Sources of imagined movements are midline or ipsilateral. Conclusions: (1) The motor networks underlying the generation of actual and imagined movements are different. (2) Imagined movements lack a primary motor area source, but involve medial and ipsilateral structures. (3) The effectiveness of imagined movements in rehabilitation may stem from activation of premotor or supplementary motor areas.<p>

<li>Grave De Peralta Menendez R, Hauk O, Andino SG, Vogt H, Michel C: Linear inverse solutions with optimal resolution kernels applied to electromagnetic tomography. Human Brain Mapping 1997;5:454-467.<p>
Summary: This paper discusses the construction of inverse solutions with optimal resolution kernels and applications of them in the reconstruction of the generators of the EEG/MEG. On the basis of the framework proposed by Backus and Gilbert [1967], we show how a family of well-known solutions ranging from the minimum norm method to the generalized Wiener estimator can be derived. It is shown that these solutions have optimal properties in some well- defined sense since they are obtained by optimizing either the resolution kernels and/or the variances of the estimates. New proposals for the optimization of resolution are made. In particular, a method termed 'weighted resolution optimization' (WROP) is introduced that deals with the difficulties inherent to the method of Backus and Gilbert [1967], from both a conceptual and a numerical point of view. One-dimensional simulations are presented to illustrate the concept and the interpretation of resolution kernels. Three-dimensional simulations shed light on the resolution properties of some linear inverse solutions when applied to the biomagnetic inverse problem. The simulations suggest that a reliable three-dimensional electromagnetic tomography based on linear inverse solutions cannot be constructed, unless significant a priori information is included. The relationship between the resolution kernels and a definition of spatial resolution is emphasized. Special consideration is given to the use of resolution kernels to assess the properties of linear inverse solutions as well as for the design of inverse solutions with optimal resolution kernels.<p>

Summary: A system (Integrated Multisensor Imaging and Processing System - IMIPS) is described which consists of techniques and protocols which have been implemented in Geneva to combine (through registration, visualization, navigation and processing) various multidimensional biomedical imaging sensors, including Electro-Magnetic Tomography (EMT), for studying, assessing, and localizing neurological (dys-)function for both clinical and research applications. The already well described interest for this combination stems from the broad variety of complementary information brought out by modern biomedical imaging modalities. In this context, the input of volumetric EMT permits direct sighting, in near real-time, of any EM (dys- )funcfional behavior. Besides allowing morphology, metabolism and function to be studied simultaneously and from different points of view, the global combination permitted by IMIPS is expected to show its best value when studying pathologies reflected by metabolic or electrophysiologic dysfunctions.<p>

Summary: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of Actovegin® on frontal and parietal electrical P300 sources revealed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) were studied in age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) patients. Actovegin is a protein-free metabolically active hemoderivative improving oxygen and glucose utilization. Each patient had, in randomized order, a treatment of 2 weeks with 250 ml 20% Actovegin and 250 ml placebo daily. Auditory ERPs were recorded before and 5 h after drug administration on day 1 (acute effect) and on day 15 (subacute and superimposed effect). Compared to age- and sex-matched normal controls, AAMI patients showed a trend towards P300 latency prolongation and a significantly reduced P300 global field power (GFP). Maximal LORETA source strength did not differ from controls. After Actovegin parietal P300 scalp amplitudes increased, while frontal and temporal amplitudes decreased as compared to placebo. This increase in hilliness, measured by the GFP, was significant. Moreover, the parietal P300 source strength increased after acute, subacute and superimposed infusion of Actovegin as compared to placebo. This may reflect improved availability of cognitive processing resources in the parietal cortex, an area that on the one hand plays an important role in fundamental aspects of attention and on the other hand has been found to be functionally impaired in dementia.<p>

Summary: The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is considered to be closely related to cognitive processes. Previous reports regarding major generators contributing to the scalp-recorded P300 suggested widely distributed multiple sources. Based on ERPs recorded in 172 normal healthy subjects aged between 20 and 88 years in an auditory oddball paradigm, electrical activity in the brain corresponding to N1 and P300 components was localized by means of low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The N1 LORETA generators, located in both auditory cortices, did not change over age. On the other hand, the P300 LORETA generators, located predominantly in the frontal neocortex and less pronounced in the posterior parietal cortex, decreased over age both in frontal and parietal source strength.<p>

<li>Van Drongelen W, Yuchtman M, Van Veen BD, Van Huffelen AC: A spatial filtering technique to detect and localize multiple sources in the brain. Brain Topography 1996;9:39-49.<p>
Summary: An algorithm for localization of electromagnetic activity in the central nervous system is explored. This algorithm generates a neural activity index map within the brain by passing surface recordings through a set of spatial filters. The covariance matrix of the surface recordings is used to optimize the spatial filters' responses. This approach is studied in simulated situations and in real data. The simulations show the method's capability to detect areas of activity without prior knowledge of the number of sources. The resolving power of the method increases with number of electrodes and signal-to-noise ratio, and it decreases with depth. The analysis of the electrophysiological data indicates that the method can distinguish simultaneously active areas in a realistic fashion. The analyzed recordings are bilateral median SEP responses, an epoch of spike activity showing several active regions and a recording with eye movement superimposed on spike activity. The method and the results are discussed in relation to current localization techniques.<p>
