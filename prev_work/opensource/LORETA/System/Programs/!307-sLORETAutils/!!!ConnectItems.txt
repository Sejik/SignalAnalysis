-------- below is the chi^2 distribution ------------------

NR: number of EEG files
NF: number of discrete frequencies in the frequency band (could be 1)
F: is the connectivity measure (ln of ratio of determinants of covariances)

Then:

2*NR*NF*F is chi^2(A*B)

where:
A=2 for total connectivity
A=1 for instantaneous or lagged connectivity
B=9 for current density ROIs signals (xyz at each voxel)
B=1 for EEG signals (1 signal at each electrode)
