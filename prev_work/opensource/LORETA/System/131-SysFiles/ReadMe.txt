
If you have an older version of sLORETA already installed, it is very highly recommended that you quit this installation now, ensure that you are not running any of the sLORETA modules, uninstall the old version, then start again and install this version. Note that there is no need to uninstall the older LORETA-KEY software.

This is a BETA sLORETA version without a formal general help file, although most modules do contain a help file.

You should open the General Tutorial, which will guide you through most of the options.

The BRL sLORETA norms 2008, a module within the Main Utilities, has its own extensive Tutorial. In order to understand the BRL sLORETA norms 2008 Tutorial, you must first study fully and exhaustively the general sLORETA Tutorial.
